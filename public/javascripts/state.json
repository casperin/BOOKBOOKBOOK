He connects these themes of today's world with his usual clear-sighted and far-reaching style to create a work which encapsulates his essential and strongest writings in one volume.

In his section on the individual he gives advice on knowing your own strengths and values, your time and, intriguingly, the second half of your life.

The result is a survey of human history, full of dazzling insights into the nature of human experience, the evolution of civilization, the culture of man. With the completion of their life's work they look back and ask what history has to say about the nature, the conduct and the prospects of man, seeking in the great lives, the great ideas, the great events of the past for the meaning of man's long journey through war, conquest and creation -- and for the great themes that can help us to understand our own era. To the Durants, history is \"not merely a warning reminder of man's follies and crimes, but also an encouraging remembrance of generative souls...a spacious country of the mind, wherein a thousand saints, statesmen, inventors, scientists, poets, artists, musicians, lovers, and philosophers still live and speak, teach and carve and sing....\" Designed to accompany the ten-volume set of The Story of Civilization, The Lessons of History is, in its own right, a profound and original work of history and philosophy.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781439170199"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1439170193"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":false},"pageCount":128,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["History"],"averageRating":4,"ratingsCount":47,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"1.5.4.0.preview.2","imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.dk/books/content?id=LWNQ2_4wkocC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.dk/books/content?id=LWNQ2_4wkocC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.dk/books?id=LWNQ2_4wkocC&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn:1439170193&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.dk/books?id=LWNQ2_4wkocC&dq=isbn:1439170193&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"http://books.google.dk/books/about/The_Lessons_of_History.html?hl=&id=LWNQ2_4wkocC"},"saleInfo":{"country":"DK","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":127.45,"currencyCode":"DKK"},"retailPrice":{"amount":86.67,"currencyCode":"DKK"},"buyLink":"http://books.google.dk/books?id=LWNQ2_4wkocC&dq=isbn:1439170193&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":127450000,"currencyCode":"DKK"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":86670000,"currencyCode":"DKK"}}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"DK","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.dk/books/download/The_Lessons_of_History-sample-epub.acsm?id=LWNQ2_4wkocC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://books.google.dk/books/reader?id=LWNQ2_4wkocC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"In this illuminating and thoughtful book, Will and Ariel Durant have succeeded in distilling for the reader the accumulated store of knowledge and experience from their four decades of work on the ten monumental volumes of The Story of ..."}}]}},{"number":null,"started":null,"finished":null,"rating":null,"details":{"kind":"books#volumes","totalItems":1,"items":[{"kind":"books#volume","id":"b0XHUvs_iBkC","etag":"c7PMcLhckUk","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/b0XHUvs_iBkC","volumeInfo":{"title":"The Fifth Discipline","subtitle":"The Art & Practice of The Learning Organization","authors":["Peter M. Senge"],"publisher":"Crown Business","publishedDate":"2010-03-31","description":"Completely Updated and Revised This revised edition of Peter Senge’s bestselling classic, The Fifth Discipline, is based on fifteen years of experience in putting the book’s ideas into practice. As Senge makes clear, in the long run the only sustainable competitive advantage is your organization’s ability to learn faster than the competition. The leadership stories in the book demonstrate the many ways that the core ideas in The Fifth Discipline, many of which seemed radical when first published in 1990, have become deeply integrated into people’s ways of seeing the world and their managerial practices. In The Fifth Discipline, Senge describes how companies can rid themselves of the learning “disabilities” that threaten their productivity and success by adopting the strategies of learning organizations—ones in which new and expansive patterns of thinking are nurtured, collective aspiration is set free, and people are continually learning how to create results they truly desire. The updated and revised Currency edition of this business classic contains over one hundred pages of new material based on interviews with dozens of practitioners at companies like BP, Unilever, Intel, Ford, HP, Saudi Aramco, and organizations like Roca, Oxfam, and The World Bank. It features a new Foreword about the success Peter Senge has achieved with learning organizations since the book’s inception, as well as new chapters on Impetus (getting started), Strategies, Leaders’ New Work, Systems Citizens, and Frontiers for the Future. Mastering the disciplines Senge outlines in the book will: • Reignite the spark of genuine learning driven by people focused on what truly matters to them • Bridge teamwork into macro-creativity • Free you of confining assumptions and mindsets • Teach you to see the forest and the trees • End the struggle between work and personal time From the Trade Paperback edition.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0307477649"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780307477644"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":false},"pageCount":464,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Business & Economics"],"averageRating":4,"ratingsCount":179,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"0.13.9.0.preview.2","imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.dk/books/content?id=b0XHUvs_iBkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.dk/books/content?id=b0XHUvs_iBkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.dk/books?id=b0XHUvs_iBkC&dq=isbn:0307477649&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.dk/books?id=b0XHUvs_iBkC&dq=isbn:0307477649&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"http://books.google.dk/books/about/The_Fifth_Discipline.html?hl=&id=b0XHUvs_iBkC"},"saleInfo":{"country":"DK","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"DK","viewability":"NO_PAGES","embeddable":false,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":true},"pdf":{"isAvailable":true},"webReaderLink":"http://books.google.dk/books/reader?id=b0XHUvs_iBkC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"NONE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"Completely Updated and Revised This revised edition of Peter Senge’s bestselling classic, The Fifth Discipline, is based on fifteen years of experience in putting the book’s ideas into practice."}}]}},{"number":null,"started":null,"finished":null,"rating":null,"details":{"kind":"books#volumes","totalItems":1,"items":[{"kind":"books#volume","id":"hB1fCgAAQBAJ","etag":"dhzpl0+V4Yo","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/hB1fCgAAQBAJ","volumeInfo":{"title":"The Rise of the Robots","subtitle":"Technology and the Threat of a Jobless Future","authors":["Martin Ford"],"publisher":"Oneworld Publications","publishedDate":"2015-09-03","description":"Intelligent algorithms are already well on their way to making white collar jobs obsolete: travel agents, data-analysts, and paralegals are currently in the firing line. In the near future, doctors, taxi-drivers and ironically even computer programmers are poised to be replaced by 'robots'. Without a radical reassessment of our economic and political structures, we risk the very implosion of the capitalist economy itself. In Rise of the Robots, technology expert Martin Ford systematically outlines the achievements of artificial intelligence and uses a wealth of economic data to illustrate the terrifying societal implications. From health and education to finance and technology, his warning is start - all jobs that are on some level routine are like to eventually be automated, resulting in the death of traditional careers and a hollowed-out middle class. The robots are coming and we have to decide – now – whether the future will bring prosperity or catastrophe.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781780747507"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1780747500"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":true},"pageCount":320,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Technology & Engineering"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"1.3.3.0.preview.3","imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.dk/books/content?id=hB1fCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.dk/books/content?id=hB1fCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.dk/books?id=hB1fCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn:1780747500&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.dk/books?id=hB1fCgAAQBAJ&dq=isbn:1780747500&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"http://books.google.dk/books/about/The_Rise_of_the_Robots.html?hl=&id=hB1fCgAAQBAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"DK","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":157.27,"currencyCode":"DKK"},"retailPrice":{"amount":110.09,"currencyCode":"DKK"},"buyLink":"http://books.google.dk/books?id=hB1fCgAAQBAJ&dq=isbn:1780747500&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":157270000,"currencyCode":"DKK"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":110090000,"currencyCode":"DKK"}}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"DK","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.dk/books/download/The_Rise_of_the_Robots-sample-epub.acsm?id=hB1fCgAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.dk/books/download/The_Rise_of_the_Robots-sample-pdf.acsm?id=hB1fCgAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"webReaderLink":"http://books.google.dk/books/reader?id=hB1fCgAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"In Rise of the Robots, technology expert Martin Ford systematically outlines the achievements of artificial intelligence and uses a wealth of economic data to illustrate the terrifying societal implications."}}]}},{"number":null,"started":null,"finished":null,"rating":null,"details":{"kind":"books#volumes","totalItems":1,"items":[{"kind":"books#volume","id":"NWxnDythozIC","etag":"s691rwlGTas","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/NWxnDythozIC","volumeInfo":{"title":"Losing My Virginity","authors":["Sir Richard Branson"],"publisher":"Random House","publishedDate":"2011-08-04","description":"This is the worldwide bestselling autobiography of iconic entrepreneur Sir Richard Branson, featuring his take on his latest business ventures, personal achievements and intrepid adventures.

Interpretation of Computer Programs\" has had a dramatic impact on computer science curricula over the past decade. This long-awaited revision contains changes throughout the text. There are new implementations of most of the major programming systems in the book, including the interpreters and compilers, and the authors have incorporated many small changes that reflect their experience teaching the course at MIT since the first edition was published. A new theme has been introduced that emphasizes the central role played by different approaches to dealing with time in computational models: objects with state, concurrent programming, functional programming and lazy evaluation, and nondeterministic programming. There are new example sections on higher-order procedures in graphics and on applications of stream processing in numerical programming, and many new exercises. In addition, all the programs have been reworked to run in any Scheme implementation that adheres to the IEEE standard.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0262510871"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780262510875"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":false},"pageCount":657,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Computers"],"averageRating":4.5,"ratingsCount":79,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"preview-1.0.0","imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.dk/books/content?id=6QOXQgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.dk/books/content?id=6QOXQgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.dk/books?id=6QOXQgAACAAJ&dq=isbn:0262510871&hl=&cd=2&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.dk/books?id=6QOXQgAACAAJ&dq=isbn:0262510871&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"http://books.google.dk/books/about/Structure_and_Interpretation_of_Computer.html?hl=&id=6QOXQgAACAAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"DK","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"DK","viewability":"NO_PAGES","embeddable":false,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":false},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://books.google.dk/books/reader?id=6QOXQgAACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"NONE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"This long-awaited revision contains changesthroughout the text.There are new implementations of most of the major programming systems in thebook, including the interpreters and compilers, and the authors have incorporated many small ..."}}]}},{"number":null,"started":null,"finished":null,"rating":null,"details":{"kind":"books#volumes","totalItems":1,"items":[{"kind":"books#volume","id":"mA3FnTSf4tcC","etag":"X4nufv2jRE4","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/mA3FnTSf4tcC","volumeInfo":{"title":"The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy","authors":["Jacob Burckhardt"],"publisher":"Penguin UK","publishedDate":"1990-06-28","description":"For nineteenth-century Swiss historian Jacob Burckhardt, the Italian Renaissance was nothing less than the beginning of the modern world - a world in which flourishing individualism and the competition for fame radically transformed science, the arts, and politics.

Thinking in Systems, is a concise and crucial book offering insight for problem solving on scales ranging from the personal to the global. Edited by the Sustainability Institute’s Diana Wright, this essential primer brings systems thinking out of the realm of computers and equations and into the tangible world, showing readers how to develop the systems-thinking skills that thought leaders across the globe consider critical for 21st-century life. Some of the biggest problems facing the world—war, hunger, poverty, and environmental degradation—are essentially system failures. They cannot be solved by fixing one piece in isolation from the others, because even seemingly minor details have enormous power to undermine the best efforts of too-narrow thinking. While readers will learn the conceptual tools and methods of systems thinking, the heart of the book is grander than methodology. Donella Meadows was known as much for nurturing positive outcomes as she was for delving into the science behind global dilemmas. She reminds readers to pay attention to what is important, not just what is quantifiable, to stay humble, and to stay a learner. In a world growing ever more complicated, crowded, and interdependent, Thinking in Systems helps readers avoid confusion and helplessness, the first step toward finding proactive and effective solutions.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1603581480"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781603581486"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":true},"pageCount":240,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Science"],"averageRating":4,"ratingsCount":117,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"0.6.6.0.preview.3","imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.dk/books/content?id=JSgOSP1qklUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.dk/books/content?id=JSgOSP1qklUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.dk/books?id=JSgOSP1qklUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn:1603581480&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.dk/books?id=JSgOSP1qklUC&dq=isbn:1603581480&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"http://books.google.dk/books/about/Thinking_in_Systems.html?hl=&id=JSgOSP1qklUC"},"saleInfo":{"country":"DK","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":136.06,"currencyCode":"DKK"},"retailPrice":{"amount":95.24,"currencyCode":"DKK"},"buyLink":"http://books.google.dk/books?id=JSgOSP1qklUC&dq=isbn:1603581480&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":136060000,"currencyCode":"DKK"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":95240000,"currencyCode":"DKK"}}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"DK","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.dk/books/download/Thinking_in_Systems-sample-epub.acsm?id=JSgOSP1qklUC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.dk/books/download/Thinking_in_Systems-sample-pdf.acsm?id=JSgOSP1qklUC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"webReaderLink":"http://books.google.dk/books/reader?id=JSgOSP1qklUC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"While readers will learn the conceptual tools and methods of systems thinking, the heart of the book is grander than methodology."}}]}},{"number":null,"started":null,"finished":null,"rating":null,"details":{"kind":"books#volumes","totalItems":1,"items":[{"kind":"books#volume","id":"ljHq6-HnW1QC","etag":"9I7zcWxCcqE","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/ljHq6-HnW1QC","volumeInfo":{"title":"The Box","subtitle":"How the Shipping Container Made the World Smaller and the World Economy Bigger","authors":["Marc Levinson"],"publisher":"Princeton University Press","publishedDate":"2010-05-20","description":"In April 1956, a refitted oil tanker carried fifty-eight shipping containers from Newark to Houston. From that modest beginning, container shipping developed into a huge industry that made the boom in global trade possible. The Box tells the dramatic story of the container's creation, the decade of struggle before it was widely adopted, and the sweeping economic consequences of the sharp fall in transportation costs that containerization brought about. Published on the fiftieth anniversary of the first container voyage, this is the first comprehensive history of the shipping container. It recounts how the drive and imagination of an iconoclastic entrepreneur, Malcom McLean, turned containerization from an impractical idea into a massive industry that slashed the cost of transporting goods around the world and made the boom in global trade possible. But the container didn't just happen. Its adoption required huge sums of money, both from private investors and from ports that aspired to be on the leading edge of a new technology. It required years of high-stakes bargaining with two of the titans of organized labor, Harry Bridges and Teddy Gleason, as well as delicate negotiations on standards that made it possible for almost any container to travel on any truck or train or ship. Ultimately, it took McLean's success in supplying U.S. forces in Vietnam to persuade the world of the container's potential. Drawing on previously neglected sources, economist Marc Levinson shows how the container transformed economic geography, devastating traditional ports such as New York and London and fueling the growth of previously obscure ones, such as Oakland. By making shipping so cheap that industry could locate factories far from its customers, the container paved the way for Asia to become the world's workshop and brought consumers a previously unimaginable variety of low-cost products from around the globe.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1400828589"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781400828586"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":true},"pageCount":400,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Business & Economics"],"averageRating":3.5,"ratingsCount":121,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"2.4.5.0.preview.3","imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.dk/books/content?id=ljHq6-HnW1QC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.dk/books/content?id=ljHq6-HnW1QC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.dk/books?id=ljHq6-HnW1QC&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn:1400828589&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.dk/books?id=ljHq6-HnW1QC&dq=isbn:1400828589&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"http://books.google.dk/books/about/The_Box.html?hl=&id=ljHq6-HnW1QC"},"saleInfo":{"country":"DK","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":176.02,"currencyCode":"DKK"},"retailPrice":{"amount":123.21,"currencyCode":"DKK"},"buyLink":"http://books.google.dk/books?id=ljHq6-HnW1QC&dq=isbn:1400828589&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":176020000,"currencyCode":"DKK"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":123210000,"currencyCode":"DKK"}}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"DK","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.dk/books/download/The_Box-sample-epub.acsm?id=ljHq6-HnW1QC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.dk/books/download/The_Box-sample-pdf.acsm?id=ljHq6-HnW1QC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"webReaderLink":"http://books.google.dk/books/reader?id=ljHq6-HnW1QC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"The Box tells the dramatic story of the container&#39;s creation, the decade of struggle before it was widely adopted, and the sweeping economic consequences of the sharp fall in transportation costs that containerization brought about."}}]}},{"number":null,"started":null,"finished":null,"rating":null,"details":{"kind":"books#volumes","totalItems":1,"items":[{"kind":"books#volume","id":"iptCAwAAQBAJ","etag":"ZK1Dlp06G88","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/iptCAwAAQBAJ","volumeInfo":{"title":"Code","subtitle":"The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software","authors":["Charles Petzold"],"publisher":"Microsoft Press","publishedDate":"2000-10-11","description":"What do flashlights, the British invasion, black cats, and seesaws have to do with computers?

It's not right that the experience of work should be so demotivating and dehumanizing.\" So says Laszlo Bock, head of People Operations at the company that transformed how the world interacts with knowledge. This insight is the heart of WORK RULES!, a compelling and surprisingly playful manifesto that offers lessons including: Take away managers' power over employees Learn from your best employees-and your worst Hire only people who are smarter than you are, no matter how long it takes to find them Pay unfairly (it's more fair!) Don't trust your gut: Use data to predict and shape the future Default to open-be transparent and welcome feedback If you're comfortable with the amount of freedom you've given your employees, you haven't gone far enough. Drawing on the latest research in behavioral economics and a profound grasp of human psychology, WORK RULES! also provides teaching examples from a range of industries-including lauded companies that happen to be hideous places to work and little-known companies that achieve spectacular results by valuing and listening to their employees. Bock takes us inside one of history's most explosively successful businesses to reveal why Google is consistently rated one of the best places to work in the world, distilling 15 years of intensive worker R&D into principles that are easy to put into action, whether you're a team of one or a team of thousands. WORK RULES! shows how to strike a balance between creativity and structure, leading to success you can measure in quality of life as well as market share. Read it to build a better company from within rather than from above; read it to reawaken your joy in what you do.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781455554805"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1455554804"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":false},"pageCount":352,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Business & Economics"],"averageRating":4,"ratingsCount":69,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"1.5.4.0.preview.2","imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.dk/books/content?id=mkmICgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.dk/books/content?id=mkmICgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.dk/books?id=mkmICgAAQBAJ&dq=isbn:1455554804&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.dk/books?id=mkmICgAAQBAJ&dq=isbn:1455554804&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"http://books.google.dk/books/about/Work_Rules.html?hl=&id=mkmICgAAQBAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"DK","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"DK","viewability":"NO_PAGES","embeddable":false,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":true},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://books.google.dk/books/reader?id=mkmICgAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"NONE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"This insight is the heart of WORK RULES!, a compelling and surprisingly playful manifesto that offers lessons including: Take away managers&#39; power over employees Learn from your best employees-and your worst Hire only people who are smarter ..."}}]}},{"number":null,"started":null,"finished":null,"rating":null,"details":{"kind":"books#volumes","totalItems":1,"items":[{"kind":"books#volume","id":"07SQBwAAQBAJ","etag":"BxTBtCgbcmk","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/07SQBwAAQBAJ","volumeInfo":{"title":"The Happy Lion","authors":["Louise Fatio"],"publisher":"Knopf Books for Young Readers","publishedDate":"2015-03-10","description":"The lion at the little French zoo is a favorite of all the townspeople.

The book helps you to continue to grow and clearly comes from people who have been there.” —Kent Beck, author of Extreme Programming Explained: Embrace Change “I found this book to be a great mix of solid advice and wonderful analogies!” —Martin Fowler, author of Refactoring and UML Distilled “I would buy a copy, read it twice, then tell all my colleagues to run out and grab a copy. This is a book I would never loan because I would worry about it being lost.” —Kevin Ruland, Management Science, MSG-Logistics “The wisdom and practical experience of the authors is obvious. The topics presented are relevant and useful.... By far its greatest strength for me has been the outstanding analogies—tracer bullets, broken windows, and the fabulous helicopter-based explanation of the need for orthogonality, especially in a crisis situation. I have little doubt that this book will eventually become an excellent source of useful information for journeymen programmers and expert mentors alike.” —John Lakos, author of Large-Scale C++ Software Design “This is the sort of book I will buy a dozen copies of when it comes out so I can give it to my clients.” —Eric Vought, Software Engineer “Most modern books on software development fail to cover the basics of what makes a great software developer, instead spending their time on syntax or technology where in reality the greatest leverage possible for any software team is in having talented developers who really know their craft well. An excellent book.” —Pete McBreen, Independent Consultant “Since reading this book, I have implemented many of the practical suggestions and tips it contains. Across the board, they have saved my company time and money while helping me get my job done quicker!

And failing that I’d settle for people who’ve read their book.” —Ward Cunningham Straight from the programming trenches, The Pragmatic Programmer cuts through the increasing specialization and technicalities of modern software development to examine the core process--taking a requirement and producing working, maintainable code that delights its users. It covers topics ranging from personal responsibility and career development to architectural techniques for keeping your code flexible and easy to adapt and reuse.

Written as a series of self-contained sections and filled with entertaining anecdotes, thoughtful examples, and interesting analogies, The Pragmatic Programmer illustrates the best practices and major pitfalls of many different aspects of software development. Whether you're a new coder, an experienced programmer, or a manager responsible for software projects, use these lessons daily, and you'll quickly see improvements in personal productivity, accuracy, and job satisfaction. You'll learn skills and develop habits and attitudes that form the foundation for long-term success in your career. You'll become a Pragmatic Programmer.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780132119177"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"013211917X"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":true},"pageCount":352,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Computers"],"averageRating":4,"ratingsCount":308,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"2.11.7.0.preview.3","imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.dk/books/content?id=5wBQEp6ruIAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.dk/books/content?id=5wBQEp6ruIAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.dk/books?id=5wBQEp6ruIAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn:013211917X&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.dk/books?id=5wBQEp6ruIAC&dq=isbn:013211917X&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"http://books.google.dk/books/about/The_Pragmatic_Programmer.html?hl=&id=5wBQEp6ruIAC"},"saleInfo":{"country":"DK","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":270.41,"currencyCode":"DKK"},"retailPrice":{"amount":189.29,"currencyCode":"DKK"},"buyLink":"http://books.google.dk/books?id=5wBQEp6ruIAC&dq=isbn:013211917X&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":270410000,"currencyCode":"DKK"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":189290000,"currencyCode":"DKK"}}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"DK","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY","epub":{"isAvailable":false},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://books.google.dk/books/reader?id=5wBQEp6ruIAC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"What others in the trenches say about The Pragmatic Programmer... “The cool thing about this book is that it’s great for keeping the programming process fresh."}}]}},{"number":null,"started":null,"finished":null,"rating":null,"details":{"kind":"books#volumes","totalItems":1,"items":[{"kind":"books#volume","id":"LohyBAAAQBAJ","etag":"MMui+qmdeHY","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/LohyBAAAQBAJ","volumeInfo":{"title":"User Story Mapping","subtitle":"Discover the Whole Story, Build the Right Product","authors":["Jeff Patton","Peter Economy"],"publisher":"\"O'Reilly Media, Inc.\"","publishedDate":"2014-09-05","description":"User story mapping is a valuable tool for software development, once you understand why and how to use it.

But as scientists break open the mind’s black box with the latest tools of neuroscience, they’re discovering that this is not how the mind works. Our best decisions are a finely tuned blend of both feeling and reason—and the precise mix depends on the situation. When buying a house, for example, it’s best to let our unconscious mull over the many variables. But when we’re picking a stock, intuition often leads us astray. The trick is to determine when to use the different parts of the brain, and to do this, we need to think harder (and smarter) about how we think. Jonah Lehrer arms us with the tools we need, drawing on cutting-edge research as well as the real-world experiences of a wide range of “deciders”—from airplane pilots and hedge fund investors to serial killers and poker players. Lehrer shows how people are taking advantage of the new science to make better television shows, win more football games, and improve military intelligence. His goal is to answer two questions that are of interest to just about anyone, from CEOs to firefighters: How does the human mind make decisions? And how can we make those decisions better?","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780547347486"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0547347480"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":true},"pageCount":256,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Science"],"averageRating":4,"ratingsCount":68,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"1.11.9.0.preview.3","imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.dk/books/content?id=QEnjzV0rTvwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.dk/books/content?id=QEnjzV0rTvwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.dk/books?id=QEnjzV0rTvwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn:0547347480&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.dk/books?id=QEnjzV0rTvwC&dq=isbn:0547347480&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"http://books.google.dk/books/about/How_We_Decide.html?hl=&id=QEnjzV0rTvwC"},"saleInfo":{"country":"DK","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"DK","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.dk/books/download/How_We_Decide-sample-epub.acsm?id=QEnjzV0rTvwC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.dk/books/download/How_We_Decide-sample-pdf.acsm?id=QEnjzV0rTvwC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"webReaderLink":"http://books.google.dk/books/reader?id=QEnjzV0rTvwC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"Reporting from the frontiers of neuroscience and armed with riveting case studies of how pilots, quarterbacks, and others act under fire, Jonah Lehrer presents a dazzlingly authoritative and accessible account of how we make decisions, ..."}}]}},{"number":null,"started":null,"finished":null,"rating":null,"details":{"kind":"books#volumes","totalItems":1,"items":[{"kind":"books#volume","id":"RDl4BgAAQBAJ","etag":"4GVeCXCzYlo","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/RDl4BgAAQBAJ","volumeInfo":{"title":"Building Microservices","authors":["Sam Newman"],"publisher":"\"O'Reilly Media, Inc.\"","publishedDate":"2015-02-02","description":"Distributed systems have become more fine-grained in the past 10 years, shifting from code-heavy monolithic applications to smaller, self-contained microservices. But developing these systems brings its own set of headaches. With lots of examples and practical advice, this book takes a holistic view of the topics that system architects and administrators must consider when building, managing, and evolving microservice architectures. Microservice technologies are moving quickly. Author Sam Newman provides you with a firm grounding in the concepts while diving into current solutions for modeling, integrating, testing, deploying, and monitoring your own autonomous services. You’ll follow a fictional company throughout the book to learn how building a microservice architecture affects a single domain. Discover how microservices allow you to align your system design with your organization’s goals Learn options for integrating a service with the rest of your system Take an incremental approach when splitting monolithic codebases Deploy individual microservices through continuous integration Examine the complexities of testing and monitoring distributed services Manage security with user-to-service and service-to-service models Understand the challenges of scaling microservice architectures","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781491950319"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1491950315"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":true},"pageCount":280,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Computers"],"averageRating":4,"ratingsCount":47,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"1.10.12.0.preview.3","imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.dk/books/content?id=RDl4BgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.dk/books/content?id=RDl4BgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.dk/books?id=RDl4BgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn:1491950315&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.dk/books?id=RDl4BgAAQBAJ&dq=isbn:1491950315&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"http://books.google.dk/books/about/Building_Microservices.html?hl=&id=RDl4BgAAQBAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"DK","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":274,"currencyCode":"DKK"},"retailPrice":{"amount":191.8,"currencyCode":"DKK"},"buyLink":"http://books.google.dk/books?id=RDl4BgAAQBAJ&dq=isbn:1491950315&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":274000000,"currencyCode":"DKK"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":191800000,"currencyCode":"DKK"}}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"DK","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":true},"pdf":{"isAvailable":true},"webReaderLink":"http://books.google.dk/books/reader?id=RDl4BgAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"With lots of examples and practical advice, this book takes a holistic view of the topics that system architects and administrators must consider when building, managing, and evolving microservice architectures."}}]}},{"number":null,"started":null,"finished":null,"rating":null,"details":{"kind":"books#volumes","totalItems":1,"items":[{"kind":"books#volume","id":"Pq3_PAAACAAJ","etag":"iVHLFDRH5Hg","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/Pq3_PAAACAAJ","volumeInfo":{"title":"Pragmatic Thinking and Learning","subtitle":"Refactor Your Wetware","authors":["Andrew Hunt"],"publisher":"Pragmatic Bookshelf","publishedDate":"2008","description":"Provides information on ways to \"refactor\" one's brain to develop better cognitive skills.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1934356050"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781934356050"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":false},"pageCount":271,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Business & Economics"],"averageRating":4.5,"ratingsCount":50,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"preview-1.0.0","imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.dk/books/content?id=Pq3_PAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.dk/books/content?id=Pq3_PAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.dk/books?id=Pq3_PAAACAAJ&dq=isbn:1934356050&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.dk/books?id=Pq3_PAAACAAJ&dq=isbn:1934356050&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"http://books.google.dk/books/about/Pragmatic_Thinking_and_Learning.html?hl=&id=Pq3_PAAACAAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"DK","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"DK","viewability":"NO_PAGES","embeddable":false,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":false},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://books.google.dk/books/reader?id=Pq3_PAAACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"NONE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"Provides information on ways to &quot;refactor&quot;

It will not only change the way you see the world; it might just change the way you live your life. And it could very well inspire you to change your world.” —Sheryl Sandberg, COO of Facebook and author of Lean In With Give and Take, Adam Grant not only introduced a landmark new paradigm for success but also established himself as one of his generation’s most compelling and provocative thought leaders. In Originals he again addresses the challenge of improving the world, but now from the perspective of becoming original: choosing to champion novel ideas and values that go against the grain, battle conformity, and buck outdated traditions. How can we originate new ideas, policies, and practices without risking it all? Using surprising studies and stories spanning business, politics, sports, and entertainment, Grant explores how to recognize a good idea, speak up without getting silenced, build a coalition of allies, choose the right time to act, and manage fear and doubt; how parents and teachers can nurture originality in children; and how leaders can build cultures that welcome dissent. Learn from an entrepreneur who pitches his start-ups by highlighting the reasons not to invest, a woman at Apple who challenged Steve Jobs from three levels below, an analyst who overturned the rule of secrecy at the CIA, a billionaire financial wizard who fires employees for failing to criticize him, and a TV executive who didn’t even work in comedy but saved Seinfeld from the cutting-room floor. The payoff is a set of groundbreaking insights about rejecting conformity and improving the status quo.
