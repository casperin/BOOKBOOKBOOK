He connects these themes of today's world with his usual clear-sighted and far-reaching style to create a work which encapsulates his essential and strongest writings in one volume. Under the three headings, Drucker covers aspects such as what the non-profits are teaching business and the information that executives need today. In his section on the individual he gives advice on knowing your own strengths and values, your time and, intriguingly, the second half of your life. The third part on society encompasses the coming of the entrepreneurial society and citizenship through the social sector. * A timeless classic from Peter F.

Senge"],"publisher":"Crown Business","publishedDate":"2010-03-31","description":"Completely Updated and Revised This revised edition of Peter Senge’s bestselling classic, The Fifth Discipline, is based on fifteen years of experience in putting the book’s ideas into practice. As Senge makes clear, in the long run the only sustainable competitive advantage is your organization’s ability to learn faster than the competition. The leadership stories in the book demonstrate the many ways that the core ideas in The Fifth Discipline, many of which seemed radical when first published in 1990, have become deeply integrated into people’s ways of seeing the world and their managerial practices. In The Fifth Discipline, Senge describes how companies can rid themselves of the learning “disabilities” that threaten their productivity and success by adopting the strategies of learning organizations—ones in which new and expansive patterns of thinking are nurtured, collective aspiration is set free, and people are continually learning how to create results they truly desire. The updated and revised Currency edition of this business classic contains over one hundred pages of new material based on interviews with dozens of practitioners at companies like BP, Unilever, Intel, Ford, HP, Saudi Aramco, and organizations like Roca, Oxfam, and The World Bank. It features a new Foreword about the success Peter Senge has achieved with learning organizations since the book’s inception, as well as new chapters on Impetus (getting started), Strategies, Leaders’ New Work, Systems Citizens, and Frontiers for the Future. Mastering the disciplines Senge outlines in the book will: • Reignite the spark of genuine learning driven by people focused on what truly matters to them • Bridge teamwork into macro-creativity • Free you of confining assumptions and mindsets • Teach you to see the forest and the trees • End the struggle between work and personal time From the Trade Paperback edition.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0307477649"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780307477644"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":false},"pageCount":464,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Business & Economics"],"averageRating":4,"ratingsCount":179,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"0.13.9.0.preview.2","imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.dk/books/content?id=b0XHUvs_iBkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.dk/books/content?id=b0XHUvs_iBkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.dk/books?id=b0XHUvs_iBkC&dq=isbn:0307477649&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.dk/books?id=b0XHUvs_iBkC&dq=isbn:0307477649&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"http://books.google.dk/books/about/The_Fifth_Discipline.html?hl=&id=b0XHUvs_iBkC"},"saleInfo":{"country":"DK","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"DK","viewability":"NO_PAGES","embeddable":false,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":true},"pdf":{"isAvailable":true},"webReaderLink":"http://books.google.dk/books/reader?id=b0XHUvs_iBkC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"NONE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"Completely Updated and Revised This revised edition of Peter Senge’s bestselling classic, The Fifth Discipline, is based on fifteen years of experience in putting the book’s ideas into practice."}}]},"bought":"2016-03-10","notes":"Best book I have ever read if judged by book that changes attitudes and behaviour.\n\nFive \"disciplines\":\n\nSystems Thinking (See 'Thinking in Systems')\n- Balancing process with delay (scale + delay)\n- Limits to growth (snowball + scale with limiting condition)\n- Shifting the burden, aka. fixing the symptoms (two scales  with snowballing side-effect between them)\n- And many more. See p. 389-400\n\nPersonal Mastery\n- \"Organizations learn only through individuals who learn. Individual learning does not guarantee organizational learning. But without it no organizational learning occurs.\n- Must come BEFORE a company vision.\n- Not the same as a purpose. The purpose is the \"why (do we exist?)\", the vision is the \"what\".\n- Comes from within\n- \"Purpose is similar to a direction, a general heading. Vision is a specific destination, a picture of a desired future. Purpose is abstract. Vision is concrete.\"\n- \"Ultimately, vision is intrinsic, not relative. It's something you desire for its intrinsic value, not because of where [sic] it stands you relative to another.\"\n- Facets: MATERIAL (Where live, how much money in bank), PERSONAL (Health, freedom, being true to ourselves), SERVICE (Helping others, contribute to the state of knowledge in a field.\n- Kazuo Inamori (founder of Kyocera): \"Whether it is research and development, company management, or any other aspect of business, the active force is \"people.\" And people have their own will, their own mind, and their own way of thinking. If the employees themselves are not sufficiently motivated to challenge the goals of growth and technological development ... there will simply be no growth, no gain in productivity, and no technological development.\"\n\nMental Models\n- The world view that we have\n- We should work towards making them explicit, so that they can be recognized as such (models) and challenged.\n- Examples: \"GM is in the business of making money, not cars.\" \"Cars are primarily status symbols. Styling is therefore more important than quality.\" -- Etc.\n- This also includes how we perceive other people, and the \"games\" we play. The \"reasons\" we say stuff in a conversation. \"I've got to find a way to light a fire under this guy\" --> \"You may be right, but I think we may need to do more than just wait.\"\n- Suspend beliefs\n- When doing this, a person is very vulnerable. It takes a lot of psychological safety to do it. It also means one should be very careful not to hurt the person opening up.\n- When advocating your view:\n  - Make your own reasoning explicit (i.e., say how you arrived at your view and the \"data\" upon which it is based)\n  - Encourage others to explore your view (e.g., \"Do you see gaps in my reasoning?\")\n  - Encourage others to provide different views (i.e., \"Do you have either different data or different conclusions, or both?\")\n  - Actively inquire into others' views that differ from your own (i.e., \"What are your views?\" \"How did you arrive at your view?\" \"Are you taking into account data that are different from what I have considered?\")\n- When inquiring into others' views:\n  - If you are making assumptions about others' views, state your assumptions clearly and acknowledge that they are assumptions\n  - State the \"data\" upon which your assumptions are based\n  - Don't bother asking questions if you're not genuinely interested in the others' response (i.e., if you're only trying to be polite or to show the others up)\n- When you arrive at an impasse (others no longer appear to be open to inquiring into their own views):\n  - Ask what data or logic might change their views\n  - Ask if there is any way you might together design an experiment (or some other inquiry) that might provide new information\n- When you or others are hesitant to express your views or to experiment with alternative ideas:\n  - Encourage them (or you) to think out loud about what might be making it difficult (i.e., \"What is it about this situation, and about me or others, that is making open exchange difficult?\")\n  - If there is mutual desire to do so, design with others ways of overcoming these barriers\n\nShared Vision\n- Remember Spartacus and how people chose death by standing up (and identifying themselves as Spartacus)\n- \"Maslow observed that in exceptional teams ... the task was no longer separate from the selv ... but rather he identified with this task so strongly that you couldn't define his real self without including that task\"\n- Personal Vision comes first, so as an organization we must first help people create those.\n- Do NOT push a vision down. It has to be created by everyone. It will also take time. Let it flow, let people on the ground talk about it, work out differences, and eventually it will be company culture.\n- The WHAT, WHY, and HOW (p. 208)\n  - Vision is the \"What?\" - the picture of the future we seek to create.\n  - Purpose (or \"mission\") is the \"Why?\" the organization's answer to the question, \"Why do we exist?\" Great organizations have a larger sense of purpose that transcends providing for the needs of shareholders and employees. They seek to contribute to the world in some unique way, to add a distinctive source of value.\n  - Core values answer the question \"How do we want to act, consistent with our mission, along the path toward achieving our vision?\" A company's values might include integrity, openness, honesty, freedom, equal opportunity, leanness, merit, or loyalty. They describe how the company wants life to be on a day-to-day basis, while pursuing the vision.\n- Possible attitudes toward a vision (p.203-204)\n  - Commitment: Wants it. Will make it happen. Creates whatever \"laws\" (structures) are needed.\n  - Enrollment: Wants it. Will do whatever can be done within the \"spirit of the law.\"\n  - Genuine compliance: Sees the benefits of the vision. Does everything expected and more. Follows the \"letter of the law.\" \"Good soldier.\"\n  - Formal compliance: On the whole, sees the benefits of the vision. Does what's expected and no more. \"Pretty good soldier.\"\n  - Grudging compliance: Does not see the benefits of the vision. But, also, does not want to lose job. Does enough of what's expected because he has to, but also lets it be known that he is not really on board.\n  - Noncompliance: Does not see benefits of vision and will not do what's expected. \"I won't do it; you can't make me.\"\n  - Apathy: Neither for nor against vision. No interest. No energy. \"Is it five o'clock yet?\"\n\nTeam Learning\n- (p. 216) \"By design and by talent, ... [we] were a team of specialists, and like a team of specialists in any field, our performance depended both on individual excellence and on how well we worked together. None of us had to strain to understand that we had to complement each other's specialities; it was simply a fact, and we all tried to figure out ways to make our combination more effective ... Off the court, most of us were oddballs by society's standards--not the kind of people who blend in with others or who tailor their personalities to match what's expected of them.\"\n- Discussion vs Dialogue, one lowers the collective IQ, the others raises it.\n- 1) All participants must \"suspend\" their assumptions, literally to hold them \"as if suspended before us\"; 2) all participants must regard one another as colleagues; 3) there must be a \"facilitator\" who \"holds the context\" of dialogue.\n- \"it cannot be stressed too much that team learning is a team skill. A group of talented individual learners will not necessarily produce a learning team, any more than a group of talented athletes will produce a great sports team. Learning teams learn how to learn together.\" (p.240)","exLibris":"Founders Library"},{"number":23,"started":"2016-04-08","finished":"2016-04-12","rating":3,"details":{"kind":"books#volumes","totalItems":1,"items":[{"kind":"books#volume","id":"hB1fCgAAQBAJ","etag":"dhzpl0+V4Yo","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/hB1fCgAAQBAJ","volumeInfo":{"title":"The Rise of the Robots","subtitle":"Technology and the Threat of a Jobless Future","authors":["Martin Ford"],"publisher":"Oneworld Publications","publishedDate":"2015-09-03","description":"Intelligent algorithms are already well on their way to making white collar jobs obsolete: travel agents, data-analysts, and paralegals are currently in the firing line.

The leader must own everything in his or her world. There is no one else to blame. The leader must acknowledge mistakes and admit failures, take ownership of them, and develop a plan to win.\nThe best leaders don't just take responsibility for their job. They take Extreme Ownership of everything that impacts their mission. This fundamental core concept enables SEAL leaders to lead high-performing teams in extraordinary circumstances and win. But EO isn't a principle whose application is limited to the battlefield. This concept is the number-one characteristic of any high-performance winning team, in any military unit, organisation, sports team or business team in any industry.\nWhen subordinates aren't doing what they should, leaders that exercise EO cannot blame the subordinates. They must first look in the mirror at themselves. The leader bears full responsibility for explaining the strategic mission, developing the tactics, and securing the training and resources to enable the team to properly and successfully execute.\nIf an individual on the team is not performing at the level required for the team to succeed, the leader must train and mentor that underperformer. But if the underperformer continually fails to meet standards, then the leader who exercises EO must be loyal to the team and the mission above any individual. If underperformers cannot improve, the leader must make the tough call to terminate them and hire others who can get the job done. It is all on the leader.\nAs individuals, we often attribute the success of others to luck or circumstances and make excuses for our own failures and the failures of our team. We blame our own poor performance on bad luck, circumstances beyond our control, or poorly performing subordinates--anyone but ourselves. Total responsibility for failure is a difficult thing to accept, and taking ownership when things go wrong requires extraordinary humility and courage. But doing just that is an absolute necessity to learning, growing as a leader, and improving a team's performance.\nEO requires leaders to look at an organisation's problems through the objective lens of reality, without emotional attachments to agendas or plans. It mandates that a leader set ego aside, accept responsibility for failures, attack weaknesses, and consistently work to build a better and more effective team. Such a leader, however, does not take credit for his or her team's successes but bestows that honor upon his subordinate leaders and team members. When  a leader sets such an example and expects this from junior leaders within the team, the mindset develops into the team's culture at every level. With EO, junior leaders take charge of their smaller teams and their piece of the mission. Efficiency and effectiveness increase exponentially and a high-performance, winning team is the result.\"\n\np. 286\n\"Extreme Ownership is a mind-set, an attitude. If leaders exhibit Extreme Ownership and develop a culture of EO within their teams and organisations, the rest falls into place. Soon, a leader no longer needs to be involved in the minor details of decisions but can look up and out to focus on the strategic mission as the team handles the tactical battles. The goal of all leaders should be to work themselves out of a job. This means leaders must be heavily engaged in training and mentoring their junior leaders to prepare them to step up and assume greater responsibilities. When mentored and coached properly, the junior leader can eventually replace the senior leader, allowing the senior leader to move on to the next level of leadership.\"\n\nDescription of leader (from p.277-278):\n- confident but not cocky\n- courageous but not foolhardy\n- competitive but a gracious loser\n- attentive to details but not obsessed by them\n- strong but have endurance\n- a leader and follower\n- humble not passive\n- aggressive not overbearing\n- quiet not silent\n- calm but not robotic, logical but not devoid of emotions\n- close with the troops but not so close that one becomes more important than another or more important than the good of the team; not so close that they forget who is in charge\n- able to execute Extreme Ownership, while exercising Decentralised Command.\n\nTopics:\n\n1) Extreme Ownership\nBasis for the whole book. You OWN the situation. If anything within the situation fails, then you failed. No excuses.\n\n2) No bad Teams,  Only bad leaders\n\n3) Believe\nThose carrying out a mission must believe in it. If you're that person and you don't, ask questions until you do. If you're the leader, make sure everyone believes.\nStory: Working with Iraqi soldiers\n\n4) Check the Ego\n\n5) Cover and move\nSupport each other. Ask for support if needed and you don't control other group\n\n6) Simple\nPlans must be SIMPLE. They should be so simple that you can operate under them during extreme pressure.\n\n7) Prioritise and Execute\nDon't do more than one thing at a time. Don't stretch yourself, or your team, thin. Find the highest priority and do that. Once it's done (or running by itself) move on to the next.\n\n8) Decentralised Command\nStory: Enemy sniper that wasn't enemy sniper and only didn't get shot because they refused due to lack of positive identification. Hold your ground if your orders do not make sense.\n\n9) Plan\nHave a plan.\n\n10) Leading up and down the chain of command\nIf boss is asking too many annoying questions, then it's because he does not have enough information. Make sure you involve and provide that info to him. Invite them to see your work, make them understand what's going on on the ground.\n\n11) Decisiveness amid uncertainty\nStory: Fire both developers who kept fighting. \n\n12) Discipline equals freedom\nStory: Shut down the department that does not make money -- even if the boss there is your friend. He'll understand."},{"number":8,"started":"2016-02-11","finished":null,"rating":null,"details":{"kind":"books#volumes","totalItems":1,"items":[{"kind":"books#volume","id":"nbrae6-9XWAC","etag":"EdUcntPE6/E","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/nbrae6-9XWAC","volumeInfo":{"title":"Rapid Development","subtitle":"Taming Wild Software Schedules","authors":["Steve McConnell"],"publisher":"\"O'Reilly Media, Inc.\"","publishedDate":"2010-03-23","description":"Corporate and commercial software-development teams all want solutions for one important problem—how to get their high-pressure development schedules under control.

Thinking in Systems, is a concise and crucial book offering insight for problem solving on scales ranging from the personal to the global. Edited by the Sustainability Institute’s Diana Wright, this essential primer brings systems thinking out of the realm of computers and equations and into the tangible world, showing readers how to develop the systems-thinking skills that thought leaders across the globe consider critical for 21st-century life. Some of the biggest problems facing the world—war, hunger, poverty, and environmental degradation—are essentially system failures. They cannot be solved by fixing one piece in isolation from the others, because even seemingly minor details have enormous power to undermine the best efforts of too-narrow thinking. While readers will learn the conceptual tools and methods of systems thinking, the heart of the book is grander than methodology. Donella Meadows was known as much for nurturing positive outcomes as she was for delving into the science behind global dilemmas. She reminds readers to pay attention to what is important, not just what is quantifiable, to stay humble, and to stay a learner. In a world growing ever more complicated, crowded, and interdependent, Thinking in Systems helps readers avoid confusion and helplessness, the first step toward finding proactive and effective solutions.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1603581480"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781603581486"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":true},"pageCount":240,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Science"],"averageRating":4,"ratingsCount":117,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"0.6.6.0.preview.3","imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.dk/books/content?id=JSgOSP1qklUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.dk/books/content?id=JSgOSP1qklUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.dk/books?id=JSgOSP1qklUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn:1603581480&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.dk/books?id=JSgOSP1qklUC&dq=isbn:1603581480&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"http://books.google.dk/books/about/Thinking_in_Systems.html?hl=&id=JSgOSP1qklUC"},"saleInfo":{"country":"DK","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":136.06,"currencyCode":"DKK"},"retailPrice":{"amount":95.24,"currencyCode":"DKK"},"buyLink":"http://books.google.dk/books?id=JSgOSP1qklUC&dq=isbn:1603581480&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":136060000,"currencyCode":"DKK"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":95240000,"currencyCode":"DKK"}}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"DK","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.dk/books/download/Thinking_in_Systems-sample-epub.acsm?id=JSgOSP1qklUC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.dk/books/download/Thinking_in_Systems-sample-pdf.acsm?id=JSgOSP1qklUC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"webReaderLink":"http://books.google.dk/books/reader?id=JSgOSP1qklUC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"While readers will learn the conceptual tools and methods of systems thinking, the heart of the book is grander than methodology."}}]},"bought":"2016-02-06","notes":"Reminders:\n- Reinforcing feedback loops\n- If A causes B, is it possible that B also causes A?\n- Oscillation\n- Delayed\n\nPlaces to intervene in a system (from least powerful, to most):\n12) Numbers--Constants and parameters such as subsidies, taxes, standards\n11) Buffers--The sizes of stabilising stocks relative to their flows\n10) Stock-and-Flow Structures--Physical systems and their nodes of intersection\n9) Delays--The lengths of time relative to the rates of system changes\n8) Balancing Feedback Loops--The strength of the feedbacks relative to the impacts they are trying to correct\n7) Reinforcing Feedback Loops--The strength of the gain of driving loops\n6) Information Flows--The structure of who does and does not have access to information\n5) Rules--Incentives, punishments, constraints\n4) Self-Organisation--The power to add, change, or evolve system structure\n3) Goals--The purpose or function of the system\n2) Paradigms--The mind-set out of which the system-its goals, structure, rules, delays, parameters--arises\n1) Transcending Paradigms","exLibris":"Founders library"},{"number":14,"started":"2016-02-14","finished":"2016-02-27","rating":4,"details":{"kind":"books#volumes","totalItems":1,"items":[{"kind":"books#volume","id":"ljHq6-HnW1QC","etag":"9I7zcWxCcqE","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/ljHq6-HnW1QC","volumeInfo":{"title":"The Box","subtitle":"How the Shipping Container Made the World Smaller and the World Economy Bigger","authors":["Marc Levinson"],"publisher":"Princeton University Press","publishedDate":"2010-05-20","description":"In April 1956, a refitted oil tanker carried fifty-eight shipping containers from Newark to Houston. From that modest beginning, container shipping developed into a huge industry that made the boom in global trade possible. The Box tells the dramatic story of the container's creation, the decade of struggle before it was widely adopted, and the sweeping economic consequences of the sharp fall in transportation costs that containerization brought about. Published on the fiftieth anniversary of the first container voyage, this is the first comprehensive history of the shipping container. It recounts how the drive and imagination of an iconoclastic entrepreneur, Malcom McLean, turned containerization from an impractical idea into a massive industry that slashed the cost of transporting goods around the world and made the boom in global trade possible. But the container didn't just happen. Its adoption required huge sums of money, both from private investors and from ports that aspired to be on the leading edge of a new technology. It required years of high-stakes bargaining with two of the titans of organized labor, Harry Bridges and Teddy Gleason, as well as delicate negotiations on standards that made it possible for almost any container to travel on any truck or train or ship. Ultimately, it took McLean's success in supplying U.S. forces in Vietnam to persuade the world of the container's potential. Drawing on previously neglected sources, economist Marc Levinson shows how the container transformed economic geography, devastating traditional ports such as New York and London and fueling the growth of previously obscure ones, such as Oakland. By making shipping so cheap that industry could locate factories far from its customers, the container paved the way for Asia to become the world's workshop and brought consumers a previously unimaginable variety of low-cost products from around the globe.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1400828589"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781400828586"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":true},"pageCount":400,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Business & Economics"],"averageRating":3.5,"ratingsCount":121,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"2.4.5.0.preview.3","imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.dk/books/content?id=ljHq6-HnW1QC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.dk/books/content?id=ljHq6-HnW1QC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.dk/books?id=ljHq6-HnW1QC&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn:1400828589&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.dk/books?id=ljHq6-HnW1QC&dq=isbn:1400828589&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"http://books.google.dk/books/about/The_Box.html?hl=&id=ljHq6-HnW1QC"},"saleInfo":{"country":"DK","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":176.02,"currencyCode":"DKK"},"retailPrice":{"amount":123.21,"currencyCode":"DKK"},"buyLink":"http://books.google.dk/books?id=ljHq6-HnW1QC&dq=isbn:1400828589&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":176020000,"currencyCode":"DKK"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":123210000,"currencyCode":"DKK"}}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"DK","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.dk/books/download/The_Box-sample-epub.acsm?id=ljHq6-HnW1QC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.dk/books/download/The_Box-sample-pdf.acsm?id=ljHq6-HnW1QC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"webReaderLink":"http://books.google.dk/books/reader?id=ljHq6-HnW1QC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"The Box tells the dramatic story of the container&#39;s creation, the decade of struggle before it was widely adopted, and the sweeping economic consequences of the sharp fall in transportation costs that containerization brought about."}}]},"bought":"2016-02-06","notes":"Incredible start-up-spirit by Malcolm McLean\n\nSo many unknowns on the grand scale.

It's not right that the experience of work should be so demotivating and dehumanizing.\" So says Laszlo Bock, head of People Operations at the company that transformed how the world interacts with knowledge. This insight is the heart of WORK RULES!, a compelling and surprisingly playful manifesto that offers lessons including: Take away managers' power over employees Learn from your best employees-and your worst Hire only people who are smarter than you are, no matter how long it takes to find them Pay unfairly (it's more fair!) Don't trust your gut: Use data to predict and shape the future Default to open-be transparent and welcome feedback If you're comfortable with the amount of freedom you've given your employees, you haven't gone far enough. Drawing on the latest research in behavioral economics and a profound grasp of human psychology, WORK RULES! also provides teaching examples from a range of industries-including lauded companies that happen to be hideous places to work and little-known companies that achieve spectacular results by valuing and listening to their employees. Bock takes us inside one of history's most explosively successful businesses to reveal why Google is consistently rated one of the best places to work in the world, distilling 15 years of intensive worker R&D into principles that are easy to put into action, whether you're a team of one or a team of thousands. WORK RULES! shows how to strike a balance between creativity and structure, leading to success you can measure in quality of life as well as market share. Read it to build a better company from within rather than from above; read it to reawaken your joy in what you do.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781455554805"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1455554804"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":false},"pageCount":352,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Business & Economics"],"averageRating":4,"ratingsCount":69,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"1.5.4.0.preview.2","imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.dk/books/content?id=mkmICgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.dk/books/content?id=mkmICgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.dk/books?id=mkmICgAAQBAJ&dq=isbn:1455554804&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.dk/books?id=mkmICgAAQBAJ&dq=isbn:1455554804&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"http://books.google.dk/books/about/Work_Rules.html?hl=&id=mkmICgAAQBAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"DK","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"DK","viewability":"NO_PAGES","embeddable":false,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":true},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://books.google.dk/books/reader?id=mkmICgAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"NONE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"This insight is the heart of WORK RULES!, a compelling and surprisingly playful manifesto that offers lessons including: Take away managers&#39; power over employees Learn from your best employees-and your worst Hire only people who are smarter ..."}}]},"exLibris":"Founders library"},{"number":null,"started":"2016-02-13","finished":"2016-02-13","rating":4,"details":{"kind":"books#volumes","totalItems":1,"items":[{"kind":"books#volume","id":"07SQBwAAQBAJ","etag":"BxTBtCgbcmk","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/07SQBwAAQBAJ","volumeInfo":{"title":"The Happy Lion","authors":["Louise Fatio"],"publisher":"Knopf Books for Young Readers","publishedDate":"2015-03-10","description":"The lion at the little French zoo is a favorite of all the townspeople.

The book helps you to continue to grow and clearly comes from people who have been there.” —Kent Beck, author of Extreme Programming Explained: Embrace Change “I found this book to be a great mix of solid advice and wonderful analogies!” —Martin Fowler, author of Refactoring and UML Distilled “I would buy a copy, read it twice, then tell all my colleagues to run out and grab a copy. This is a book I would never loan because I would worry about it being lost.” —Kevin Ruland, Management Science, MSG-Logistics “The wisdom and practical experience of the authors is obvious. The topics presented are relevant and useful.... By far its greatest strength for me has been the outstanding analogies—tracer bullets, broken windows, and the fabulous helicopter-based explanation of the need for orthogonality, especially in a crisis situation. I have little doubt that this book will eventually become an excellent source of useful information for journeymen programmers and expert mentors alike.” —John Lakos, author of Large-Scale C++ Software Design “This is the sort of book I will buy a dozen copies of when it comes out so I can give it to my clients.” —Eric Vought, Software Engineer “Most modern books on software development fail to cover the basics of what makes a great software developer, instead spending their time on syntax or technology where in reality the greatest leverage possible for any software team is in having talented developers who really know their craft well. An excellent book.” —Pete McBreen, Independent Consultant “Since reading this book, I have implemented many of the practical suggestions and tips it contains. Across the board, they have saved my company time and money while helping me get my job done quicker! This should be a desktop reference for everyone who works with code for a living.” —Jared Richardson, Senior Software Developer, iRenaissance, Inc. “I would like to see this issued to every new employee at my company....” —Chris Cleeland, Senior Software Engineer, Object Computing, Inc. “If I’m putting together a project, it’s the authors of this book that I want. . . . And failing that I’d settle for people who’ve read their book.” —Ward Cunningham Straight from the programming trenches, The Pragmatic Programmer cuts through the increasing specialization and technicalities of modern software development to examine the core process--taking a requirement and producing working, maintainable code that delights its users. It covers topics ranging from personal responsibility and career development to architectural techniques for keeping your code flexible and easy to adapt and reuse. Read this book, and you'll learn how to Fight software rot; Avoid the trap of duplicating knowledge; Write flexible, dynamic, and adaptable code; Avoid programming by coincidence; Bullet-proof your code with contracts, assertions, and exceptions; Capture real requirements; Test ruthlessly and effectively; Delight your users; Build teams of pragmatic programmers; and Make your developments more precise with automation. Written as a series of self-contained sections and filled with entertaining anecdotes, thoughtful examples, and interesting analogies, The Pragmatic Programmer illustrates the best practices and major pitfalls of many different aspects of software development. Whether you're a new coder, an experienced programmer, or a manager responsible for software projects, use these lessons daily, and you'll quickly see improvements in personal productivity, accuracy, and job satisfaction. You'll learn skills and develop habits and attitudes that form the foundation for long-term success in your career. You'll become a Pragmatic Programmer.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780132119177"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"013211917X"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":true},"pageCount":352,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Computers"],"averageRating":4,"ratingsCount":308,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"2.11.7.0.preview.3","imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.dk/books/content?id=5wBQEp6ruIAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.dk/books/content?id=5wBQEp6ruIAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.dk/books?id=5wBQEp6ruIAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn:013211917X&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.dk/books?id=5wBQEp6ruIAC&dq=isbn:013211917X&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"http://books.google.dk/books/about/The_Pragmatic_Programmer.html?hl=&id=5wBQEp6ruIAC"},"saleInfo":{"country":"DK","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":270.41,"currencyCode":"DKK"},"retailPrice":{"amount":189.29,"currencyCode":"DKK"},"buyLink":"http://books.google.dk/books?id=5wBQEp6ruIAC&dq=isbn:013211917X&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":270410000,"currencyCode":"DKK"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":189290000,"currencyCode":"DKK"}}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"DK","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY","epub":{"isAvailable":false},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://books.google.dk/books/reader?id=5wBQEp6ruIAC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"What others in the trenches say about The Pragmatic Programmer... “The cool thing about this book is that it’s great for keeping the programming process fresh."}}]}},{"number":null,"started":"2016-02-03","finished":"2016-02-04","rating":4,"details":{"kind":"books#volumes","totalItems":1,"items":[{"kind":"books#volume","id":"LohyBAAAQBAJ","etag":"MMui+qmdeHY","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/LohyBAAAQBAJ","volumeInfo":{"title":"User Story Mapping","subtitle":"Discover the Whole Story, Build the Right Product","authors":["Jeff Patton","Peter Economy"],"publisher":"\"O'Reilly Media, Inc.\"","publishedDate":"2014-09-05","description":"User story mapping is a valuable tool for software development, once you understand why and how to use it.

But as scientists break open the mind’s black box with the latest tools of neuroscience, they’re discovering that this is not how the mind works. Our best decisions are a finely tuned blend of both feeling and reason—and the precise mix depends on the situation. When buying a house, for example, it’s best to let our unconscious mull over the many variables. But when we’re picking a stock, intuition often leads us astray. The trick is to determine when to use the different parts of the brain, and to do this, we need to think harder (and smarter) about how we think. Jonah Lehrer arms us with the tools we need, drawing on cutting-edge research as well as the real-world experiences of a wide range of “deciders”—from airplane pilots and hedge fund investors to serial killers and poker players. Lehrer shows how people are taking advantage of the new science to make better television shows, win more football games, and improve military intelligence. His goal is to answer two questions that are of interest to just about anyone, from CEOs to firefighters: How does the human mind make decisions? And how can we make those decisions better?","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780547347486"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0547347480"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":true},"pageCount":256,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Science"],"averageRating":4,"ratingsCount":68,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"1.11.9.0.preview.3","imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.dk/books/content?id=QEnjzV0rTvwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.dk/books/content?id=QEnjzV0rTvwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.dk/books?id=QEnjzV0rTvwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn:0547347480&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.dk/books?id=QEnjzV0rTvwC&dq=isbn:0547347480&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"http://books.google.dk/books/about/How_We_Decide.html?hl=&id=QEnjzV0rTvwC"},"saleInfo":{"country":"DK","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"DK","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.dk/books/download/How_We_Decide-sample-epub.acsm?id=QEnjzV0rTvwC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.dk/books/download/How_We_Decide-sample-pdf.acsm?id=QEnjzV0rTvwC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"webReaderLink":"http://books.google.dk/books/reader?id=QEnjzV0rTvwC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"Reporting from the frontiers of neuroscience and armed with riveting case studies of how pilots, quarterbacks, and others act under fire, Jonah Lehrer presents a dazzlingly authoritative and accessible account of how we make decisions, ..."}}]},"bought":"2016-01-09","notes":"Emotions are a sort of memory that we can't control or understand.\n\nIt's a way for us to sort through previous experience and make a correct choice without having to actually do the work with our conscious brain.\n\nIntuition is ↑"},{"number":4,"started":"2016-01-26","finished":"2016-01-28","rating":3,"details":{"kind":"books#volumes","totalItems":1,"items":[{"kind":"books#volume","id":"RDl4BgAAQBAJ","etag":"4GVeCXCzYlo","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/RDl4BgAAQBAJ","volumeInfo":{"title":"Building Microservices","authors":["Sam Newman"],"publisher":"\"O'Reilly Media, Inc.\"","publishedDate":"2015-02-02","description":"Distributed systems have become more fine-grained in the past 10 years, shifting from code-heavy monolithic applications to smaller, self-contained microservices.

It will not only change the way you see the world; it might just change the way you live your life. And it could very well inspire you to change your world.” —Sheryl Sandberg, COO of Facebook and author of Lean In With Give and Take, Adam Grant not only introduced a landmark new paradigm for success but also established himself as one of his generation’s most compelling and provocative thought leaders. In Originals he again addresses the challenge of improving the world, but now from the perspective of becoming original: choosing to champion novel ideas and values that go against the grain, battle conformity, and buck outdated traditions. How can we originate new ideas, policies, and practices without risking it all? Using surprising studies and stories spanning business, politics, sports, and entertainment, Grant explores how to recognize a good idea, speak up without getting silenced, build a coalition of allies, choose the right time to act, and manage fear and doubt; how parents and teachers can nurture originality in children; and how leaders can build cultures that welcome dissent. Learn from an entrepreneur who pitches his start-ups by highlighting the reasons not to invest, a woman at Apple who challenged Steve Jobs from three levels below, an analyst who overturned the rule of secrecy at the CIA, a billionaire financial wizard who fires employees for failing to criticize him, and a TV executive who didn’t even work in comedy but saved Seinfeld from the cutting-room floor. The payoff is a set of groundbreaking insights about rejecting conformity and improving the status quo.

Why don't Meyers-Briggs personality tests really work? Why are HR tests for new employees often meaningless? Why doesn't BMI - body mass index - correlate to actual health or physical fitness? Individuals behave, learn, and develop in different ways, but these unique patterns of human behavior get lost in massive systems that play to average performance and average abilities, instead of individual performance and abilities. These systems made sense almost two centuries ago at the dawn of the Industrial Revolution, but in today's globalized digital world they are outdated and inadequate. Yet, every single one of us is affected by these archaic systems. They are far more prevalent that you can imagine, and far more insidious: standardized tests, academic grading systems, job applicant profiling, job performance reviews, job training, even medical treatments. These systems ignore our differences and ultimately fail at measuring and maximizing our potential.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780141980027"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0141980028"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":false},"pageCount":256,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Psychology"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"1.2.2.0.preview.2","imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.dk/books/content?id=w7-zCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.dk/books/content?id=w7-zCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.dk/books?id=w7-zCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn:0141980028&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.dk/books?id=w7-zCgAAQBAJ&dq=isbn:0141980028&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"http://books.google.dk/books/about/The_End_of_Average.html?hl=&id=w7-zCgAAQBAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"DK","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":109,"currencyCode":"DKK"},"retailPrice":{"amount":109,"currencyCode":"DKK"},"buyLink":"http://books.google.dk/books?id=w7-zCgAAQBAJ&dq=isbn:0141980028&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":109000000,"currencyCode":"DKK"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":109000000,"currencyCode":"DKK"}}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"DK","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.dk/books/download/The_End_of_Average-sample-epub.acsm?id=w7-zCgAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://books.google.dk/books/reader?id=w7-zCgAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"Todd Rose draws on the very latest findings in the fields of psychology and sociology to show how, when we focus on individual findings rather than group averages, we are empowered to rethink the world and our place in it."}}]},"bought":"2016-03-10"},{"number":18,"started":"2016-03-22","finished":"2016-03-24","rating":4,"details":{"kind":"books#volumes","totalItems":1,"items":[{"kind":"books#volume","id":"LWNQ2_4wkocC","etag":"hOXbKauvXlY","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/LWNQ2_4wkocC","volumeInfo":{"title":"The Lessons of History","authors":["Will Durant","Ariel Durant"],"publisher":"Simon and Schuster","publishedDate":"2012-08-21","description":"In this illuminating and thoughtful book, Will and Ariel Durant have succeeded in distilling for the reader the accumulated store of knowledge and experience from their four decades of work on the ten monumental volumes of The Story of Civilization. The result is a survey of human history, full of dazzling insights into the nature of human experience, the evolution of civilization, the culture of man. With the completion of their life's work they look back and ask what history has to say about the nature, the conduct and the prospects of man, seeking in the great lives, the great ideas, the great events of the past for the meaning of man's long journey through war, conquest and creation -- and for the great themes that can help us to understand our own era.

In this marvellously clear and accessible narrative, Walter Isaacson explains how his mind worked and the mysteries of the universe that he discovered. Einstein's success came from questioning conventional wisdom and marvelling at mysteries that struck others as mundane. This led him to embrace a worldview based on respect for free spirits and free individuals. All of which helped make Einstein into a rebel but with a reverence for the harmony of nature, one with just the right blend of imagination and wisdom to transform our understanding of the universe.

A prominent biologist, ecological philosopher, and keen student of human population control, Hardin now offers the finest summation of his work to date, with an eloquent argument for accepting the limits of the earth's resources--and the hard choices we must make to live within them. In Living Within Limits, Hardin focuses on the neglected problem of overpopulation, making a forceful case for dramatically changing the way we live in and manage our world. Our world itself, he writes, is in the dilemma of the lifeboat: it can only hold a certain number of people before it sinks--not everyone can be saved. The old idea of progress and limitless growth misses the point that the earth (and each part of it) has a limited carrying capacity; sentimentality should not cloud our ability to take necessary steps to limit population. But Hardin refutes the notion that goodwill and voluntary restraints will be enough. Instead, nations where population is growing must suffer the consequences alone. Too often, he writes, we operate on the faulty principle of shared costs matched with private profits. In Hardin's famous essay, \"The Tragedy of the Commons,\" he showed how a village common pasture suffers from overgrazing because each villager puts as many cattle on it as possible--since the costs of grazing are shared by everyone, but the profits go to the individual. The metaphor applies to global ecology, he argues, making a powerful case for closed borders and an end to immigration from poor nations to rich ones. \"The production of human beings is the result of very localized human actions; corrective action must be local....Globalizing the 'population problem' would only ensure that it would never be solved.\" Hardin does not shrink from the startling implications of his argument, as he criticizes the shipment of food to overpopulated regions and asserts that coercion in population control is inevitable. But he also proposes a free flow of information across boundaries, to allow each state to help itself. \"The time-honored practice of pollute and move on is no longer acceptable,\" Hardin tells us.

What's in the book is less interesting than the thoughts it conjured up in my mind.\n\n\"Sniping\" is (apparently) a type of posters that is highly focused (hence the word), illegal, and low budget. These posters will be taken down (since they are illegal), but just as fast they will be put up again.\n\nThey often use outrageous imagery to get its idea through to its target. Humour is important. Standing out in a sea of information in any way possible, as well as their repeated appearance help them punch through.\n\nThese, especially, made me think of how we reach out at Founders. Say, would it make sense to map each day out of a prospect (they are mostly people like ourselves anyway), and then find the touch points which nobody else seems to occupy.\n\nOr how about \"ads\" that toootally overstate how much our solution helps out customers. Like for Duuoo, we have a narrative of a veeery sad employee and a troubled employer, but once they buy out product everything is just amazing! (the employee is dancing down the halls and jumping with joy, that's how awesome it is!)... Of course in a \"We don't take ourselves too seriously\" tone.\n\n---\n\nThe outrageousness of the poster-world reminds me a lot of Richard Branson. He's \"out there\", not taking himself too seriously; yet doing the right thing as well as taking a lot of risks. \n\n---\n\nThe Japanese flag is amazing.\n\nTurn stuff you don't need to read-READ sideways (like page numbers or titles).","details":{"kind":"books#volumes","totalItems":1,"items":[{"kind":"books#volume","id":"9WHRrQEACAAJ","etag":"TUrPaOID+Ng","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/9WHRrQEACAAJ","volumeInfo":{"title":"How Posters Work","authors":["Ellen Lupton","Caitlin Condell","Gail Davidson"],"publisher":"Cooper Hewitt","publishedDate":"2015-05-26","description":"How Posters Work is more than a standard exhibition catalogue. Conceived as a useful and illuminating primer in visual thinking, it explores principles of design through a range of historical and contemporary works, uncovering ideas relevant not just to the design of posters but to 2D design more generally. How Posters Work has a unique focus on visual language. Rather than provide a history of the genre or a compilation of collectibles, the book is organized around active design principles. Concepts such as Simplify, Focus the eye, Exploit the diagonal, Reverse expectations, and Say two things at once are illustrated with a diverse range of posters, from avant-garde classics and rarely seen international works to contemporary pieces by todays leading graphic designers. Illustrated with over 150 works from the collection of Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum, How Posters Work provides a stunning education in seeing and making, demonstrating how some of the worlds most creative designers have mobilized principles of layout, composition, psychology, and rhetoric to produce powerful acts of visual communication","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0910503826"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780910503822"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":false},"pageCount":208,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Design"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"preview-1.0.0","imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.dk/books/content?id=9WHRrQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.dk/books/content?id=9WHRrQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.dk/books?id=9WHRrQEACAAJ&dq=isbn:0910503826&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.dk/books?id=9WHRrQEACAAJ&dq=isbn:0910503826&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"http://books.google.dk/books/about/How_Posters_Work.html?hl=&id=9WHRrQEACAAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"DK","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"DK","viewability":"NO_PAGES","embeddable":false,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":false},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://books.google.dk/books/reader?id=9WHRrQEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"NONE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"How Posters Work has a unique focus on visual language.
