He connects these themes of today's world with his usual clear-sighted and far-reaching style to create a work which encapsulates his essential and strongest writings in one volume. Under the three headings, Drucker covers aspects such as what the non-profits are teaching business and the information that executives need today. In his section on the individual he gives advice on knowing your own strengths and values, your time and, intriguingly, the second half of your life. The third part on society encompasses the coming of the entrepreneurial society and citizenship through the social sector. * A timeless classic from Peter F.

It is the customer who determines what a business is. It is the customer alone whose willingness to pay for a good or for a service converts economic resources into wealth, things into goods. What the customer buys and considers value is never just a product. It is always a utility, that is, what a product or service does for him.\" (p15.ml) [#business](business)\n\n---\n\nOn what marketing really is: [#marketing](marketing) \"True marketing starts out the way Sears starts out--with the customer, his demographics, his realities, his needs, his values. It does not ask, What do want to sell? It asks, What does the customer want to buy? It does not say, This is what our product or service does. It says, These are the satisfactions the customer looks for, values, and needs.\" (p.16.m)\n\n---\n\nEffective leadership doesn't depend on charisma. Dwight Eisenhower, and Harry Truman were singularly effective leaders, yet none possessed any more charisma than a dead mackerel. ... Indeed, charisma becomes the undoing of leaders. It makes them inflexible, convinced of their own infallibility, unable to change. This is what happened to Stalin, Hitler, and Mao, and it is a commonplace in the study of ancient history that only Alexander the Great's early death saved him from becoming an ineffectual failure. (p.203.b) [#leadership](leadership)\n\nLeadership is [#leadership](leadership) (p.204-205)\n1. *Work*. The foundation of effective leadership is thinking through the organisation's mission, defining it, and establishing it, clearly and visibly. The leader sets the goals, sets the priorities, and sets and maintains the standards.\n2. The leader see leadership as *responsibility* rather than as a rank and privilege. \n3. *Earn trust*. Otherwise there won't be any followers--and the only definition of a leader is someone who has followers. To trust a leader, it is not necessary to like him. Nor is it necessary to agree with him. Trust is the conviction that the leader means what he says. It is a belief in something very old-fashioned, called \"integrity.\" A leader's actions and a leader's professed beliefs must be congruent, or at least compatible. Effective leadership--and again this is very old wisdom--is not based on being clever; it is based primarily on being consistent.\n\n\n## Decision making\n\nFeatures of making a decision [#decision](decision) (p.184.m)\n1. The clear realisation that the problem was generic and could only be solve through a decision that established a rule, a principle.\n2. The definition of the specifications that the answer to the problem had to satisfy, that is, of the \"boundary conditions\"\n3. The thinking through what is \"right,\" that is, the solution that will fully satisfy the specifications *before* attention is given to the compromises, adaptations, and concessions needed to make the decision acceptable.\n4. The building into the decision of the action to carry it out.\n5. The \"feedback\" that tests the validity and effectiveness of the decision against the actual course of events.\n\nWhen making a decision you want opinions first (before facts). If everyone agrees you have a potential problem in that you might not fully understand the problem. You want disagreements. And then you want to find out what tests these opinions as true or false. Before you have this, you should not make an important decision. (freestyle from p.190-197) [#decision](decision)\n\n## Objectives\n\nA business' *definitions*, *purpose*, and *mission* must be translated into objectives: [#objectives](objectives) (p.22.T)\n1. Objectives must be derived from \"what our business is, what it will be, and what it should be.\" ... Objectives represent the *fundamental strategy of a business*.\n2. Objectives must be *operational*. ...\n3. Objectives must make possible *concentration* of resources and efforts. ... They must be selective rather than encompass everything.\n4. There must be *multiple objectives* rather than a single objective. ...\n5. Objectives are needed in all areas on which the *survival* of the business depends. ...\n\n---\n\nObjectives are needed in these areas: [#objectives](objectives) (p.23.t) (see examples of each in the following pages)\n* Marketing\n* Innovation\n* Human resources\n* Financial resources\n* Physical resources\n* Productivity\n* Social responsibility\n* Profit requirements\n\n## Entrepreneur\n\n\"Not to innovate is the single largest reason for the decline of existing organizations. Not to know how to manage is the single largest reason for the failure of new ventures.\" (p.7.m) [#innovation](innovation)\n\n---\n\nDos, Don'ts, and conditions of innovation [#innovation](innovation) (p.207-209)\n* Do\n    1. Purposeful, systematic innovation begins with the analysis of the opportunities.\n    2. Go out and look, to ask, to listen.\n    3. An innovation, to be effective, has to be simple and it has to be focused. It should do only one thing; otherwise, it confuses. If it is not simple, it won't work.\n    4. Effective innovations start small. They are not grandiose. They try to do one specific thing. ... Innovations had better be capable of being started small, requiring at first little money, few people, and only a small and limited market. Otherwise, there is not enough time to make the adjustments and changes that are almost always needed for an innovation to succeed.\n    5. A successful innovation aims at leadership. It does not aim necessarily at becoming eventually a \"big business\"; in fact, no one can foretell whether a given innovation will end up as a big business or a modest achievement. ... But all entrepreneurial strategies, that is, all strategies aimed at exploiting an innovation, must achieve leadership within a given environment. Otherwise, they will simply create an opportunity for the competition.\n* Don't\n    1. Don't try to be clever. Has to be handled by ordinary people.\n    2. Don't diversify; don't splinter; don't try to do too many things at once.\n    3. Don't try to innovate for the future. Innovate for the present!\n* Conditions\n    1. *Innovation is work*. It requires knowledge. It often requires great ingenuity. There are clearly people who are more talented innovators than the rest of us. ... But when all is said and done, innovation becomes hard, focused, purposeful work making very great demands on diligence, on persistence, and on commitment. If these are lacking, no amount of talent, ingenuity, or knowledge will avail.\n    2. *To succeed, innovators must build on their strengths*. Successful innovators look at opportunities over a wide range. But then they ask, Which of these opportunities fits *me, fits this company*, puts to work what we (or I) are good at and have shown capacity for in performance?\n    3. *Innovation is an effect in economy and society*, a change in the behaviour of customers, of teachers, of farmers, of eye surgeons--of people in general. ... Innovation therefor always has to be close to the market, focused on the market, indeed market-driven.\n\n---\n\n\"I ... know a good many successful innovators and entrepreneurs. Not one of them has a \"propensity for risk-taking.\" The popular picture of innovators--half pop-psychology, half Hollywood--makes them look like a cross between Superman and the Knights of the Round Table. Alas, most of them in real life are unromantic figures, and much more likely to spend hours on a cashflow projection than to dash off looking for \"risks.\" ... Successful innovators are conservative. They have to be. They are not \"risk-focused\"; they are \"opportunity-focused.\" (p.211.m) [#entrepreneur](entrepreneur)\n\n---\n\n\"Entrepreneurial management in the new venture has four requirements: (p.109.T) [#startup](startup)\n1. A focus on the market &rarr; Look for opportunities and failures. Even where you don't expect them. [#marketing](marketing)\n2. financial foresight, and especially planning for cash flow and capital needs ahead &rarr; The more successful the more important this is. Don't aim for profit; you have to pay taxes of that. Focus on cash flow.\n3. building a top management team long before the new venture actually needs one and long before it can actually afford one &rarr; This is important because it takes a lot of time to form a team. To find the right people, and for them to find their right position. [#team](team)\n4. the founding entrepreneur needs to make a decision in respect to his or  her own role, area of work, and relationships &rarr; \"Where can I contribute?\"\n\n---\n\n\"Where the conventional wisdom goes wrong is in its assumption that entrepreneurship and innovation are natural, creative, or spontaneous. If entrepreneurship and innovation do not well up in an organisation, something must  be stifling them. ... But entrepreneurship is not 'natural'; it is not 'creative.' It is work. ... They can be learned, but it requires effort. Entrepreneurial businesses treat entrepreneurship as a duty. They are disciplined about it... they work at it... they practice it.\" (p.103.md) [#innovation](innovation)\n\nDrucker goes on to explain how to achieve it in big companies.\n\n---\n\n\"Knowledge workers knows more about what they're doing than anyone else in the company, and should be treated more like volunteers than workers. They need more than just money. They need, above all challenge. They need to know the organization's mission and to believe in it. They need continual training. They need to see results\".  [#employee](employee)\n\n---\n\nStartup strategies: [#startup](startup)\n1. \"Being fustest with the mostest\" &rarr; Head-on. Very difficult to pull off.\n2. \"Hitting them where they ain't\"\n    * Creating imitation: IBM used the ENIAC design (which was for scientific purposes) and did a few changes and sold it to companies to do payroll stuff.\n    * \"Entrepreneurial Judo: Take advantage of the \"not invented here\" syndrome.\n3. Finding and occupying a specialised \"ecological niche\" &rarr; Think early Paypal\n    * Toll-gate strategy: Alcon Company created and patented an enzyme that you didn't need a lot of (for some surgery), but it was absolutely necessary.\n        * Must be essential to a process. The risk of not using must be infinitely greater than the cost of the product.\n        * The market must be so limited that whoever occupies it first preempts it. It must be a true \"ecological niche\" that one species fills completely, and which at the same time is small and discreet enough not to attract rivels.\n    * Speciality skill strategy: Be the best at something obscure. Like Bosh at making headlights for cars.\n        * \"A specialty skill niche is rarely found by accident. In every case, it results from a systematic survey of innovative opportunities. In every case, the entrepreneur looks for the place where a specialty skill can be developed and can give a new enterprise a unique controlling position.\"\n        * \"In the early stages of a new industry, a new market, or a new major trend, there is the opportunity to search systematically for the specialty skill opportunity--and then there is usually time to develop a unique skill.\n        * \"the specialty skill niche does require a skill that is both unique and different. (mechanics makes cars, but headlights require theory about electricity).\n    * Speciality market strategy: \"The major difference between the specialty skill niche and the specialty market niche is that the former is built around a product or service and the latter around specialised knowledge of a market. Otherwise, they are similar.\n4. Changing the economic characteristics of a product, a market, or an industry\n    * Creating utility\n    * Pricing\n    * Adaptation to the customer's social and economic reality\n    * Delivering what represents true value to the customer\n\n---\n\nNew companies: Most important is to build top management. Ask: [#startup](startup)\n1. \"What will the venture need objectively by way of management from here on out?\"\n2. \"What am I good at? What, of all these needs to the ventures, could I supply, and supply with distinction?\"\n3. \"What do I really want to do, and believe in doing? What am I willing to spend years on, if not the rest rest of my life? Is this something the venture really needs? Is it a mayor, essential, indispensable contribution?\"\n\nParts of a business: Administration, Finance, Distribution, Marketing, Sales, Personel, Production.\n\n## Personal\n\n\"'Feedback analysis.' Whenever one makes a key decision, and whenever one does a key action, one writes down what one expects will happen. And nine months, or twelve months later, one then feeds back from results to expectations.\" (p.166.t) [#self-development](self-development) [#personal](personal)\n\n---\n\n\"To be effective, every knowledge worker, and especially every executive, therefore needs to be able to dispose of time in fairly large chunks. To have small dribs and drabs of time at his disposal will not be sufficient even if the total is an impressive number of hours.\" (p.174.t) [#personal](personal) [#time-management](time-management)\n\n---\n\nFor any professional goes: *primum non nocere* (First, do no harm). We can not promise not to do harm, but we can promise to not *knowingly* do harm. \"The manager who fails to think through and work for the appropriate solution to an impact of his business because it makes him 'unpopular in the club' knowingly does harm.\" (p.49.t) In the business world we often see it in: [#personal](personal) [#conduct](conduct)\n* Executive compensation\n* Use of benefit plans to impose \"golden fetters\" on people in the company's employ.\n* Their profit rhetoric: \"... make it impossible for the public to understand economic reality. This violates the requirement that managers, being leaders, not knowingly do harm.\"\n\n---\n\nFocus on contribution [#personal](personal) [#conduct](conduct)\n\"The great majority of people tend to focus downward. They are occupied with efforts rather than with results. They worry over what the organisation and their superiors \"owe\" them and should do for them. And they are conscious above all of the authority they \"should have.\" As a result, they render themselves ineffectual.\" (p.157.m)\n\n\"Effective knowledge workers ... are almost imperceptibly led by their upward orientation into finding out what the other fellow needs, what the other fellow sees, and what the other fellow understands. Effective people find themselves asking other people in the organisation, their superiors, their subordinates, but above all, their colleagues in other areas, 'What contribution from me do you require to make *your* contribution to the organisation? When do you need this, how do you need it, and in what form?\" (p.161.m) [#personal](personal)\n\nContribution by knowledge workers are primarily: (p.162.b) [#personal](personal)\n1. Communications\n2. Teamwork\n3. Self-development - \"The man who asks of himself, What is the most important contribution I can make to the performance of this organisation? asks in effect, What self-development do I need? What knowledge and skill do I have to acquire to make the contribution I should be making? What strengths do I have to put to work? What standards do I have to set myself?\n4. Development of others\n\n\"We neither need nor will get 'polymaths,' who are at home in many knowledges; in fact, we will probably become even more specialised. But what we do need--and what will define the educated person in the knowledge society--is the ability to *understand* the various knowledges. What is each one about? What is it trying to do? What are its central concerns and theories? What major new insights las it produced? What are its important areas of ignorance, its problems, its challenges?\" [#personal](personal) (p.223.tm)\n\n## Picking people\n\nBasic principles for people decisions (p.96.T)\n1. If I put a person into a job and he or she does not perform, I have made a mistake: I fell for the Peter Principle.\n2. \"The soldier has a right to a competent command\"...\n3. \"Of all the decisions an executive makes, none is as important as the decisions about people because they determine the performance capacity of the organisation. Therefore, I'd better make these decisions well.\"\n4. Don't give new people major assignments, for doing so only compounds the risks. ... Put a high-level newcomer first into an established position where the expectations are known and help is available\".\n\nThe decision steps: (p.96.mb)\n1. Think through the assignment ...\n2. Look at a number of qualified people ... 3-5 for most jobs.\n3. Think hard about how to look at these candidates ... find their strengths and match them with the assignment.\n4. Discuss each of the candidates with several people who have worked with them.\n5. Make sure the appointee understands the job. ... \"You have now been [new job] for three months. What do you have to do to be a success in your new job? Think it through and come back in a week or ten days and show me in writing. But I can tell you one thing right away: the things you did to get the promotion are almost certainly the wrong things to do now.\"\n\n"},{"number":21,"started":"2016-03-24","finished":"2016-04-02","rating":5,"details":{"kind":"books#volumes","totalItems":1,"items":[{"kind":"books#volume","id":"b0XHUvs_iBkC","etag":"c7PMcLhckUk","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/b0XHUvs_iBkC","volumeInfo":{"title":"The Fifth Discipline","subtitle":"The Art & Practice of The Learning Organization","authors":["Peter M.

As Senge makes clear, in the long run the only sustainable competitive advantage is your organization’s ability to learn faster than the competition. The leadership stories in the book demonstrate the many ways that the core ideas in The Fifth Discipline, many of which seemed radical when first published in 1990, have become deeply integrated into people’s ways of seeing the world and their managerial practices. In The Fifth Discipline, Senge describes how companies can rid themselves of the learning “disabilities” that threaten their productivity and success by adopting the strategies of learning organizations—ones in which new and expansive patterns of thinking are nurtured, collective aspiration is set free, and people are continually learning how to create results they truly desire. The updated and revised Currency edition of this business classic contains over one hundred pages of new material based on interviews with dozens of practitioners at companies like BP, Unilever, Intel, Ford, HP, Saudi Aramco, and organizations like Roca, Oxfam, and The World Bank. It features a new Foreword about the success Peter Senge has achieved with learning organizations since the book’s inception, as well as new chapters on Impetus (getting started), Strategies, Leaders’ New Work, Systems Citizens, and Frontiers for the Future. Mastering the disciplines Senge outlines in the book will: • Reignite the spark of genuine learning driven by people focused on what truly matters to them • Bridge teamwork into macro-creativity • Free you of confining assumptions and mindsets • Teach you to see the forest and the trees • End the struggle between work and personal time From the Trade Paperback edition.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0307477649"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780307477644"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":false},"pageCount":464,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Business & Economics"],"averageRating":4,"ratingsCount":179,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"0.13.9.0.preview.2","imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.dk/books/content?id=b0XHUvs_iBkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.dk/books/content?id=b0XHUvs_iBkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.dk/books?id=b0XHUvs_iBkC&dq=isbn:0307477649&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.dk/books?id=b0XHUvs_iBkC&dq=isbn:0307477649&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"http://books.google.dk/books/about/The_Fifth_Discipline.html?hl=&id=b0XHUvs_iBkC"},"saleInfo":{"country":"DK","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"DK","viewability":"NO_PAGES","embeddable":false,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":true},"pdf":{"isAvailable":true},"webReaderLink":"http://books.google.dk/books/reader?id=b0XHUvs_iBkC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"NONE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"Completely Updated and Revised This revised edition of Peter Senge’s bestselling classic, The Fifth Discipline, is based on fifteen years of experience in putting the book’s ideas into practice."}}]},"bought":"2016-03-10","notes":"Best book I have ever read if judged by book that changes attitudes and behaviour.\n\n## Five \"disciplines\"\n\nSystems Thinking (See 'Thinking in Systems') [#systems-thinking](systems-thinking)\n- Balancing process with delay (scale + delay)\n- Limits to growth (snowball + scale with limiting condition)\n- Shifting the burden, aka. fixing the symptoms (two scales  with snowballing side-effect between them)\n- And many more.

Vision is a specific destination, a picture of a desired future. Purpose is abstract. Vision is concrete.\"\n- \"Ultimately, vision is intrinsic, not relative. It's something you desire for its intrinsic value, not because of where [sic] it stands you relative to another.\"\n- Facets: MATERIAL (Where live, how much money in bank), PERSONAL (Health, freedom, being true to ourselves), SERVICE (Helping others, contribute to the state of knowledge in a field.\n- Kazuo Inamori (founder of Kyocera): \"Whether it is research and development, company management, or any other aspect of business, the active force is \"people.\" And people have their own will, their own mind, and their own way of thinking.

Styling is therefore more important than quality.\" -- Etc.\n- This also includes how we perceive other people, and the \"games\" we play. The \"reasons\" we say stuff in a conversation. \"I've got to find a way to light a fire under this guy\" --> \"You may be right, but I think we may need to do more than just wait.\"\n- Suspend beliefs\n- When doing this, a person is very vulnerable. It takes a lot of psychological safety to do it. It also means one should be very careful not to hurt the person opening up.\n- When advocating your view:\n  - Make your own reasoning explicit (i.e., say how you arrived at your view and the \"data\" upon which it is based)\n  - Encourage others to explore your view (e.g., \"Do you see gaps in my reasoning?\")\n  - Encourage others to provide different views (i.e., \"Do you have either different data or different conclusions, or both?\")\n  - Actively inquire into others' views that differ from your own (i.e., \"What are your views?\" \"How did you arrive at your view?\" \"Are you taking into account data that are different from what I have considered?\")\n- When inquiring into others' views:\n  - If you are making assumptions about others' views, state your assumptions clearly and acknowledge that they are assumptions\n  - State the \"data\" upon which your assumptions are based\n  - Don't bother asking questions if you're not genuinely interested in the others' response (i.e., if you're only trying to be polite or to show the others up)\n- When you arrive at an impasse (others no longer appear to be open to inquiring into their own views):\n  - Ask what data or logic might change their views\n  - Ask if there is any way you might together design an experiment (or some other inquiry) that might provide new information\n- When you or others are hesitant to express your views or to experiment with alternative ideas:\n  - Encourage them (or you) to think out loud about what might be making it difficult (i.e., \"What is it about this situation, and about me or others, that is making open exchange difficult?\")\n  - If there is mutual desire to do so, design with others ways of overcoming these barriers\n\nShared Vision [#team](team)\n- Remember Spartacus and how people chose death by standing up (and identifying themselves as Spartacus)\n- \"Maslow observed that in exceptional teams ... the task was no longer separate from the selv ... but rather he identified with this task so strongly that you couldn't define his real self without including that task\"\n- Personal Vision comes first, so as an organization we must first help people create those.\n- Do NOT push a vision down.

They seek to contribute to the world in some unique way, to add a distinctive source of value.\n  - Core values answer the question \"How do we want to act, consistent with our mission, along the path toward achieving our vision?\" A company's values might include integrity, openness, honesty, freedom, equal opportunity, leanness, merit, or loyalty. They describe how the company wants life to be on a day-to-day basis, while pursuing the vision.\n- Possible attitudes toward a vision (p.203-204)\n  - Commitment: Wants it. Will make it happen. Creates whatever \"laws\" (structures) are needed.\n  - Enrollment: Wants it. Will do whatever can be done within the \"spirit of the law.\"\n  - Genuine compliance: Sees the benefits of the vision. Does everything expected and more. Follows the \"letter of the law.\" \"Good soldier.\"\n  - Formal compliance: On the whole, sees the benefits of the vision. Does what's expected and no more. \"Pretty good soldier.\"\n  - Grudging compliance: Does not see the benefits of the vision. But, also, does not want to lose job. Does enough of what's expected because he has to, but also lets it be known that he is not really on board.\n  - Noncompliance: Does not see benefits of vision and will not do what's expected. \"I won't do it; you can't make me.\"\n  - Apathy: Neither for nor against vision. No interest. No energy. \"Is it five o'clock yet?\"\n\nTeam Learning [#team](team)\n- (p. 216) \"By design and by talent, ...

In the near future, doctors, taxi-drivers and ironically even computer programmers are poised to be replaced by 'robots'. Without a radical reassessment of our economic and political structures, we risk the very implosion of the capitalist economy itself. In Rise of the Robots, technology expert Martin Ford systematically outlines the achievements of artificial intelligence and uses a wealth of economic data to illustrate the terrifying societal implications. From health and education to finance and technology, his warning is start - all jobs that are on some level routine are like to eventually be automated, resulting in the death of traditional careers and a hollowed-out middle class. The robots are coming and we have to decide – now – whether the future will bring prosperity or catastrophe.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781780747507"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1780747500"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":true},"pageCount":320,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Technology & Engineering"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"1.3.3.0.preview.3","imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.dk/books/content?id=hB1fCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.dk/books/content?id=hB1fCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.dk/books?id=hB1fCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn:1780747500&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.dk/books?id=hB1fCgAAQBAJ&dq=isbn:1780747500&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"http://books.google.dk/books/about/The_Rise_of_the_Robots.html?hl=&id=hB1fCgAAQBAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"DK","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":157.27,"currencyCode":"DKK"},"retailPrice":{"amount":110.09,"currencyCode":"DKK"},"buyLink":"http://books.google.dk/books?id=hB1fCgAAQBAJ&dq=isbn:1780747500&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":157270000,"currencyCode":"DKK"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":110090000,"currencyCode":"DKK"}}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"DK","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.dk/books/download/The_Rise_of_the_Robots-sample-epub.acsm?id=hB1fCgAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.dk/books/download/The_Rise_of_the_Robots-sample-pdf.acsm?id=hB1fCgAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"webReaderLink":"http://books.google.dk/books/reader?id=hB1fCgAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"In Rise of the Robots, technology expert Martin Ford systematically outlines the achievements of artificial intelligence and uses a wealth of economic data to illustrate the terrifying societal implications."}}]},"bought":"2016-02-28","notes":"The case of how advances in technology will render most ordinary jobs obsolete, and thus most people without a job and income.

With riveting first-hand accounts of making high-pressure decisions as Navy SEAL battlefield leaders, this book is equally gripping for leaders who seek to dominate other arenas. Jocko and Leif served together in SEAL Task Unit Bruiser, the most highly decorated Special Operations unit from the war in Iraq. Their efforts contributed to the historic triumph for U.S. forces in Ramadi. Through those difficult months of sustained combat, Jocko, Leif and their SEAL brothers learned that leadership--at every level--is the most important thing on the battlefield. They started Echelon Front to teach these same leadership principles to companies across industries throughout the business world that want to build their own high-performance, winning teams. This book explains the SEAL leadership concepts crucial to accomplishing the most difficult missions in combat and how to apply them to any group, team, or organization. It provides the reader with Jocko and Leif's formula for success: the mindset and guiding principles that enable SEAL combat units to achieve extraordinary results.

The leader must own everything in his or her world. There is no one else to blame. The leader must acknowledge mistakes and admit failures, take ownership of them, and develop a plan to win.\nThe best leaders don't just take responsibility for their job. They take Extreme Ownership of everything that impacts their mission. This fundamental core concept enables SEAL leaders to lead high-performing teams in extraordinary circumstances and win. But EO isn't a principle whose application is limited to the battlefield. This concept is the number-one characteristic of any high-performance winning team, in any military unit, organisation, sports team or business team in any industry.\nWhen subordinates aren't doing what they should, leaders that exercise EO cannot blame the subordinates. They must first look in the mirror at themselves. The leader bears full responsibility for explaining the strategic mission, developing the tactics, and securing the training and resources to enable the team to properly and successfully execute.\nIf an individual on the team is not performing at the level required for the team to succeed, the leader must train and mentor that underperformer. But if the underperformer continually fails to meet standards, then the leader who exercises EO must be loyal to the team and the mission above any individual. If underperformers cannot improve, the leader must make the tough call to terminate them and hire others who can get the job done. It is all on the leader.\nAs individuals, we often attribute the success of others to luck or circumstances and make excuses for our own failures and the failures of our team. We blame our own poor performance on bad luck, circumstances beyond our control, or poorly performing subordinates--anyone but ourselves. Total responsibility for failure is a difficult thing to accept, and taking ownership when things go wrong requires extraordinary humility and courage. But doing just that is an absolute necessity to learning, growing as a leader, and improving a team's performance.\nEO requires leaders to look at an organisation's problems through the objective lens of reality, without emotional attachments to agendas or plans. It mandates that a leader set ego aside, accept responsibility for failures, attack weaknesses, and consistently work to build a better and more effective team. Such a leader, however, does not take credit for his or her team's successes but bestows that honor upon his subordinate leaders and team members. When  a leader sets such an example and expects this from junior leaders within the team, the mindset develops into the team's culture at every level. With EO, junior leaders take charge of their smaller teams and their piece of the mission. Efficiency and effectiveness increase exponentially and a high-performance, winning team is the result.\"\n\np. 286 [#leadership](leadership)\n\"Extreme Ownership is a mind-set, an attitude. If leaders exhibit Extreme Ownership and develop a culture of EO within their teams and organisations, the rest falls into place. Soon, a leader no longer needs to be involved in the minor details of decisions but can look up and out to focus on the strategic mission as the team handles the tactical battles. The goal of all leaders should be to work themselves out of a job. This means leaders must be heavily engaged in training and mentoring their junior leaders to prepare them to step up and assume greater responsibilities. When mentored and coached properly, the junior leader can eventually replace the senior leader, allowing the senior leader to move on to the next level of leadership.\"\n\nDescription of leader (from p.277-278): [#leadership](leadership) [#personal](personal)\n- confident but not cocky\n- courageous but not foolhardy\n- competitive but a gracious loser\n- attentive to details but not obsessed by them\n- strong but have endurance\n- a leader and follower\n- humble not passive\n- aggressive not overbearing\n- quiet not silent\n- calm but not robotic, logical but not devoid of emotions\n- close with the troops but not so close that one becomes more important than another or more important than the good of the team; not so close that they forget who is in charge\n- able to execute Extreme Ownership, while exercising Decentralised Command.\n\nTopics:\n\n1) Extreme Ownership\nBasis for the whole book. You OWN the situation. If anything within the situation fails, then you failed. No excuses.\n\n2) No bad Teams,  Only bad leaders\n\n3) Believe\nThose carrying out a mission must believe in it. If you're that person and you don't, ask questions until you do. If you're the leader, make sure everyone believes.\nStory: Working with Iraqi soldiers\n\n4) Check the Ego\n\n5) Cover and move\nSupport each other. Ask for support if needed and you don't control other group\n\n6) Simple\nPlans must be SIMPLE. They should be so simple that you can operate under them during extreme pressure.\n\n7) Prioritise and Execute\nDon't do more than one thing at a time. Don't stretch yourself, or your team, thin. Find the highest priority and do that. Once it's done (or running by itself) move on to the next.\n\n8) Decentralised Command\nStory: Enemy sniper that wasn't enemy sniper and only didn't get shot because they refused due to lack of positive identification. Hold your ground if your orders do not make sense.\n\n9) Plan\nHave a plan.\n\n10) Leading up and down the chain of command\nIf boss is asking too many annoying questions, then it's because he does not have enough information. Make sure you involve and provide that info to him. Invite them to see your work, make them understand what's going on on the ground.\n\n11) Decisiveness amid uncertainty\nStory: Fire both developers who kept fighting. \n\n12) Discipline equals freedom\nStory: Shut down the department that does not make money -- even if the boss there is your friend.

Thinking in Systems, is a concise and crucial book offering insight for problem solving on scales ranging from the personal to the global. Edited by the Sustainability Institute’s Diana Wright, this essential primer brings systems thinking out of the realm of computers and equations and into the tangible world, showing readers how to develop the systems-thinking skills that thought leaders across the globe consider critical for 21st-century life. Some of the biggest problems facing the world—war, hunger, poverty, and environmental degradation—are essentially system failures. They cannot be solved by fixing one piece in isolation from the others, because even seemingly minor details have enormous power to undermine the best efforts of too-narrow thinking. While readers will learn the conceptual tools and methods of systems thinking, the heart of the book is grander than methodology. Donella Meadows was known as much for nurturing positive outcomes as she was for delving into the science behind global dilemmas. She reminds readers to pay attention to what is important, not just what is quantifiable, to stay humble, and to stay a learner. In a world growing ever more complicated, crowded, and interdependent, Thinking in Systems helps readers avoid confusion and helplessness, the first step toward finding proactive and effective solutions.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1603581480"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781603581486"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":true},"pageCount":240,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Science"],"averageRating":4,"ratingsCount":117,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"0.6.6.0.preview.3","imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.dk/books/content?id=JSgOSP1qklUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.dk/books/content?id=JSgOSP1qklUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.dk/books?id=JSgOSP1qklUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn:1603581480&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.dk/books?id=JSgOSP1qklUC&dq=isbn:1603581480&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"http://books.google.dk/books/about/Thinking_in_Systems.html?hl=&id=JSgOSP1qklUC"},"saleInfo":{"country":"DK","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":136.06,"currencyCode":"DKK"},"retailPrice":{"amount":95.24,"currencyCode":"DKK"},"buyLink":"http://books.google.dk/books?id=JSgOSP1qklUC&dq=isbn:1603581480&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":136060000,"currencyCode":"DKK"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":95240000,"currencyCode":"DKK"}}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"DK","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.dk/books/download/Thinking_in_Systems-sample-epub.acsm?id=JSgOSP1qklUC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.dk/books/download/Thinking_in_Systems-sample-pdf.acsm?id=JSgOSP1qklUC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"webReaderLink":"http://books.google.dk/books/reader?id=JSgOSP1qklUC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"While readers will learn the conceptual tools and methods of systems thinking, the heart of the book is grander than methodology."}}]},"bought":"2016-02-06","notes":"Reminders: [#systems-thinking](systems-thinking)\n- Reinforcing feedback loops\n- If A causes B, is it possible that B also causes A?\n- Oscillation\n- Delayed\n\nPlaces to intervene in a system (from least powerful, to most): [#systems-thinking](systems-thinking)\n1) Transcending Paradigms\"\n2) Paradigms--The mind-set out of which the system-its goals, structure, rules, delays, parameters--arises\n3) Goals--The purpose or function of the system\n4) Self-Organisation--The power to add, change, or evolve system structure\n5) Rules--Incentives, punishments, constraints\n6) Information Flows--The structure of who does and does not have access to information\n7) Reinforcing Feedback Loops--The strength of the gain of driving loops\n8) Balancing Feedback Loops--The strength of the feedbacks relative to the impacts they are trying to correct\n9) Delays--The lengths of time relative to the rates of system changes\n10) Stock-and-Flow Structures--Physical systems and their nodes of intersection\n11) Buffers--The sizes of stabilising stocks relative to their flows\n12) Numbers--Constants and parameters such as subsidies, taxes, standards\n","exLibris":null},{"number":14,"started":"2016-02-14","finished":"2016-02-27","rating":4,"details":{"kind":"books#volumes","totalItems":1,"items":[{"kind":"books#volume","id":"ljHq6-HnW1QC","etag":"9I7zcWxCcqE","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/ljHq6-HnW1QC","volumeInfo":{"title":"The Box","subtitle":"How the Shipping Container Made the World Smaller and the World Economy Bigger","authors":["Marc Levinson"],"publisher":"Princeton University Press","publishedDate":"2010-05-20","description":"In April 1956, a refitted oil tanker carried fifty-eight shipping containers from Newark to Houston. From that modest beginning, container shipping developed into a huge industry that made the boom in global trade possible. The Box tells the dramatic story of the container's creation, the decade of struggle before it was widely adopted, and the sweeping economic consequences of the sharp fall in transportation costs that containerization brought about. Published on the fiftieth anniversary of the first container voyage, this is the first comprehensive history of the shipping container. It recounts how the drive and imagination of an iconoclastic entrepreneur, Malcom McLean, turned containerization from an impractical idea into a massive industry that slashed the cost of transporting goods around the world and made the boom in global trade possible. But the container didn't just happen. Its adoption required huge sums of money, both from private investors and from ports that aspired to be on the leading edge of a new technology. It required years of high-stakes bargaining with two of the titans of organized labor, Harry Bridges and Teddy Gleason, as well as delicate negotiations on standards that made it possible for almost any container to travel on any truck or train or ship. Ultimately, it took McLean's success in supplying U.S. forces in Vietnam to persuade the world of the container's potential. Drawing on previously neglected sources, economist Marc Levinson shows how the container transformed economic geography, devastating traditional ports such as New York and London and fueling the growth of previously obscure ones, such as Oakland. By making shipping so cheap that industry could locate factories far from its customers, the container paved the way for Asia to become the world's workshop and brought consumers a previously unimaginable variety of low-cost products from around the globe.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1400828589"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781400828586"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":true},"pageCount":400,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Business & Economics"],"averageRating":3.5,"ratingsCount":121,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"2.4.5.0.preview.3","imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.dk/books/content?id=ljHq6-HnW1QC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.dk/books/content?id=ljHq6-HnW1QC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.dk/books?id=ljHq6-HnW1QC&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn:1400828589&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.dk/books?id=ljHq6-HnW1QC&dq=isbn:1400828589&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"http://books.google.dk/books/about/The_Box.html?hl=&id=ljHq6-HnW1QC"},"saleInfo":{"country":"DK","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":176.02,"currencyCode":"DKK"},"retailPrice":{"amount":123.21,"currencyCode":"DKK"},"buyLink":"http://books.google.dk/books?id=ljHq6-HnW1QC&dq=isbn:1400828589&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":176020000,"currencyCode":"DKK"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":123210000,"currencyCode":"DKK"}}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"DK","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.dk/books/download/The_Box-sample-epub.acsm?id=ljHq6-HnW1QC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.dk/books/download/The_Box-sample-pdf.acsm?id=ljHq6-HnW1QC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"webReaderLink":"http://books.google.dk/books/reader?id=ljHq6-HnW1QC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"The Box tells the dramatic story of the container&#39;s creation, the decade of struggle before it was widely adopted, and the sweeping economic consequences of the sharp fall in transportation costs that containerization brought about."}}]},"bought":"2016-02-06","notes":"Incredible start-up-spirit by Malcolm McLean\n\nSo many unknowns on the grand scale.

It's not right that the experience of work should be so demotivating and dehumanizing.\" So says Laszlo Bock, head of People Operations at the company that transformed how the world interacts with knowledge. This insight is the heart of WORK RULES!, a compelling and surprisingly playful manifesto that offers lessons including: Take away managers' power over employees Learn from your best employees-and your worst Hire only people who are smarter than you are, no matter how long it takes to find them Pay unfairly (it's more fair!) Don't trust your gut: Use data to predict and shape the future Default to open-be transparent and welcome feedback If you're comfortable with the amount of freedom you've given your employees, you haven't gone far enough. Drawing on the latest research in behavioral economics and a profound grasp of human psychology, WORK RULES! also provides teaching examples from a range of industries-including lauded companies that happen to be hideous places to work and little-known companies that achieve spectacular results by valuing and listening to their employees. Bock takes us inside one of history's most explosively successful businesses to reveal why Google is consistently rated one of the best places to work in the world, distilling 15 years of intensive worker R&D into principles that are easy to put into action, whether you're a team of one or a team of thousands. WORK RULES! shows how to strike a balance between creativity and structure, leading to success you can measure in quality of life as well as market share. Read it to build a better company from within rather than from above; read it to reawaken your joy in what you do.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781455554805"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1455554804"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":false},"pageCount":352,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Business & Economics"],"averageRating":4,"ratingsCount":69,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"1.5.4.0.preview.2","imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.dk/books/content?id=mkmICgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.dk/books/content?id=mkmICgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.dk/books?id=mkmICgAAQBAJ&dq=isbn:1455554804&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.dk/books?id=mkmICgAAQBAJ&dq=isbn:1455554804&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"http://books.google.dk/books/about/Work_Rules.html?hl=&id=mkmICgAAQBAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"DK","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"DK","viewability":"NO_PAGES","embeddable":false,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":true},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://books.google.dk/books/reader?id=mkmICgAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"NONE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"This insight is the heart of WORK RULES!, a compelling and surprisingly playful manifesto that offers lessons including: Take away managers&#39; power over employees Learn from your best employees-and your worst Hire only people who are smarter ..."}}]},"exLibris":null,"bought":"2016-02-17"},{"number":null,"started":"2016-02-13","finished":"2016-02-13","rating":4,"details":{"kind":"books#volumes","totalItems":1,"items":[{"kind":"books#volume","id":"07SQBwAAQBAJ","etag":"BxTBtCgbcmk","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/07SQBwAAQBAJ","volumeInfo":{"title":"The Happy Lion","authors":["Louise Fatio"],"publisher":"Knopf Books for Young Readers","publishedDate":"2015-03-10","description":"The lion at the little French zoo is a favorite of all the townspeople.

The book helps you to continue to grow and clearly comes from people who have been there.” —Kent Beck, author of Extreme Programming Explained: Embrace Change “I found this book to be a great mix of solid advice and wonderful analogies!” —Martin Fowler, author of Refactoring and UML Distilled “I would buy a copy, read it twice, then tell all my colleagues to run out and grab a copy. This is a book I would never loan because I would worry about it being lost.” —Kevin Ruland, Management Science, MSG-Logistics “The wisdom and practical experience of the authors is obvious. The topics presented are relevant and useful.... By far its greatest strength for me has been the outstanding analogies—tracer bullets, broken windows, and the fabulous helicopter-based explanation of the need for orthogonality, especially in a crisis situation. I have little doubt that this book will eventually become an excellent source of useful information for journeymen programmers and expert mentors alike.” —John Lakos, author of Large-Scale C++ Software Design “This is the sort of book I will buy a dozen copies of when it comes out so I can give it to my clients.” —Eric Vought, Software Engineer “Most modern books on software development fail to cover the basics of what makes a great software developer, instead spending their time on syntax or technology where in reality the greatest leverage possible for any software team is in having talented developers who really know their craft well. An excellent book.” —Pete McBreen, Independent Consultant “Since reading this book, I have implemented many of the practical suggestions and tips it contains. Across the board, they have saved my company time and money while helping me get my job done quicker! This should be a desktop reference for everyone who works with code for a living.” —Jared Richardson, Senior Software Developer, iRenaissance, Inc. “I would like to see this issued to every new employee at my company....” —Chris Cleeland, Senior Software Engineer, Object Computing, Inc. “If I’m putting together a project, it’s the authors of this book that I want. . . . And failing that I’d settle for people who’ve read their book.” —Ward Cunningham Straight from the programming trenches, The Pragmatic Programmer cuts through the increasing specialization and technicalities of modern software development to examine the core process--taking a requirement and producing working, maintainable code that delights its users. It covers topics ranging from personal responsibility and career development to architectural techniques for keeping your code flexible and easy to adapt and reuse. Read this book, and you'll learn how to Fight software rot; Avoid the trap of duplicating knowledge; Write flexible, dynamic, and adaptable code; Avoid programming by coincidence; Bullet-proof your code with contracts, assertions, and exceptions; Capture real requirements; Test ruthlessly and effectively; Delight your users; Build teams of pragmatic programmers; and Make your developments more precise with automation. Written as a series of self-contained sections and filled with entertaining anecdotes, thoughtful examples, and interesting analogies, The Pragmatic Programmer illustrates the best practices and major pitfalls of many different aspects of software development. Whether you're a new coder, an experienced programmer, or a manager responsible for software projects, use these lessons daily, and you'll quickly see improvements in personal productivity, accuracy, and job satisfaction. You'll learn skills and develop habits and attitudes that form the foundation for long-term success in your career. You'll become a Pragmatic Programmer.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780132119177"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"013211917X"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":true},"pageCount":352,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Computers"],"averageRating":4,"ratingsCount":308,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"2.11.7.0.preview.3","imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.dk/books/content?id=5wBQEp6ruIAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.dk/books/content?id=5wBQEp6ruIAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.dk/books?id=5wBQEp6ruIAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn:013211917X&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.dk/books?id=5wBQEp6ruIAC&dq=isbn:013211917X&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"http://books.google.dk/books/about/The_Pragmatic_Programmer.html?hl=&id=5wBQEp6ruIAC"},"saleInfo":{"country":"DK","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":270.41,"currencyCode":"DKK"},"retailPrice":{"amount":189.29,"currencyCode":"DKK"},"buyLink":"http://books.google.dk/books?id=5wBQEp6ruIAC&dq=isbn:013211917X&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":270410000,"currencyCode":"DKK"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":189290000,"currencyCode":"DKK"}}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"DK","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY","epub":{"isAvailable":false},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://books.google.dk/books/reader?id=5wBQEp6ruIAC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"What others in the trenches say about The Pragmatic Programmer... “The cool thing about this book is that it’s great for keeping the programming process fresh."}}]}},{"number":null,"started":"2016-02-03","finished":"2016-02-04","rating":4,"details":{"kind":"books#volumes","totalItems":1,"items":[{"kind":"books#volume","id":"LohyBAAAQBAJ","etag":"MMui+qmdeHY","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/LohyBAAAQBAJ","volumeInfo":{"title":"User Story Mapping","subtitle":"Discover the Whole Story, Build the Right Product","authors":["Jeff Patton","Peter Economy"],"publisher":"\"O'Reilly Media, Inc.\"","publishedDate":"2014-09-05","description":"User story mapping is a valuable tool for software development, once you understand why and how to use it.

But as scientists break open the mind’s black box with the latest tools of neuroscience, they’re discovering that this is not how the mind works. Our best decisions are a finely tuned blend of both feeling and reason—and the precise mix depends on the situation. When buying a house, for example, it’s best to let our unconscious mull over the many variables. But when we’re picking a stock, intuition often leads us astray. The trick is to determine when to use the different parts of the brain, and to do this, we need to think harder (and smarter) about how we think. Jonah Lehrer arms us with the tools we need, drawing on cutting-edge research as well as the real-world experiences of a wide range of “deciders”—from airplane pilots and hedge fund investors to serial killers and poker players. Lehrer shows how people are taking advantage of the new science to make better television shows, win more football games, and improve military intelligence. His goal is to answer two questions that are of interest to just about anyone, from CEOs to firefighters: How does the human mind make decisions?

With lots of examples and practical advice, this book takes a holistic view of the topics that system architects and administrators must consider when building, managing, and evolving microservice architectures. Microservice technologies are moving quickly. Author Sam Newman provides you with a firm grounding in the concepts while diving into current solutions for modeling, integrating, testing, deploying, and monitoring your own autonomous services. You’ll follow a fictional company throughout the book to learn how building a microservice architecture affects a single domain.

It will not only change the way you see the world; it might just change the way you live your life. And it could very well inspire you to change your world.” —Sheryl Sandberg, COO of Facebook and author of Lean In With Give and Take, Adam Grant not only introduced a landmark new paradigm for success but also established himself as one of his generation’s most compelling and provocative thought leaders. In Originals he again addresses the challenge of improving the world, but now from the perspective of becoming original: choosing to champion novel ideas and values that go against the grain, battle conformity, and buck outdated traditions. How can we originate new ideas, policies, and practices without risking it all? Using surprising studies and stories spanning business, politics, sports, and entertainment, Grant explores how to recognize a good idea, speak up without getting silenced, build a coalition of allies, choose the right time to act, and manage fear and doubt; how parents and teachers can nurture originality in children; and how leaders can build cultures that welcome dissent. Learn from an entrepreneur who pitches his start-ups by highlighting the reasons not to invest, a woman at Apple who challenged Steve Jobs from three levels below, an analyst who overturned the rule of secrecy at the CIA, a billionaire financial wizard who fires employees for failing to criticize him, and a TV executive who didn’t even work in comedy but saved Seinfeld from the cutting-room floor. The payoff is a set of groundbreaking insights about rejecting conformity and improving the status quo.

Why don't Meyers-Briggs personality tests really work? Why are HR tests for new employees often meaningless? Why doesn't BMI - body mass index - correlate to actual health or physical fitness? Individuals behave, learn, and develop in different ways, but these unique patterns of human behavior get lost in massive systems that play to average performance and average abilities, instead of individual performance and abilities. These systems made sense almost two centuries ago at the dawn of the Industrial Revolution, but in today's globalized digital world they are outdated and inadequate. Yet, every single one of us is affected by these archaic systems. They are far more prevalent that you can imagine, and far more insidious: standardized tests, academic grading systems, job applicant profiling, job performance reviews, job training, even medical treatments. These systems ignore our differences and ultimately fail at measuring and maximizing our potential.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780141980027"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0141980028"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":false},"pageCount":256,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Psychology"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"1.2.2.0.preview.2","imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.dk/books/content?id=w7-zCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.dk/books/content?id=w7-zCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.dk/books?id=w7-zCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn:0141980028&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.dk/books?id=w7-zCgAAQBAJ&dq=isbn:0141980028&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"http://books.google.dk/books/about/The_End_of_Average.html?hl=&id=w7-zCgAAQBAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"DK","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":109,"currencyCode":"DKK"},"retailPrice":{"amount":109,"currencyCode":"DKK"},"buyLink":"http://books.google.dk/books?id=w7-zCgAAQBAJ&dq=isbn:0141980028&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":109000000,"currencyCode":"DKK"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":109000000,"currencyCode":"DKK"}}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"DK","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.dk/books/download/The_End_of_Average-sample-epub.acsm?id=w7-zCgAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://books.google.dk/books/reader?id=w7-zCgAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"Todd Rose draws on the very latest findings in the fields of psychology and sociology to show how, when we focus on individual findings rather than group averages, we are empowered to rethink the world and our place in it."}}]},"bought":"2016-03-10"},{"number":18,"started":"2016-03-22","finished":"2016-03-24","rating":4,"details":{"kind":"books#volumes","totalItems":1,"items":[{"kind":"books#volume","id":"LWNQ2_4wkocC","etag":"hOXbKauvXlY","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/LWNQ2_4wkocC","volumeInfo":{"title":"The Lessons of History","authors":["Will Durant","Ariel Durant"],"publisher":"Simon and Schuster","publishedDate":"2012-08-21","description":"In this illuminating and thoughtful book, Will and Ariel Durant have succeeded in distilling for the reader the accumulated store of knowledge and experience from their four decades of work on the ten monumental volumes of The Story of Civilization.

In this marvellously clear and accessible narrative, Walter Isaacson explains how his mind worked and the mysteries of the universe that he discovered. Einstein's success came from questioning conventional wisdom and marvelling at mysteries that struck others as mundane. This led him to embrace a worldview based on respect for free spirits and free individuals. All of which helped make Einstein into a rebel but with a reverence for the harmony of nature, one with just the right blend of imagination and wisdom to transform our understanding of the universe.

A prominent biologist, ecological philosopher, and keen student of human population control, Hardin now offers the finest summation of his work to date, with an eloquent argument for accepting the limits of the earth's resources--and the hard choices we must make to live within them. In Living Within Limits, Hardin focuses on the neglected problem of overpopulation, making a forceful case for dramatically changing the way we live in and manage our world. Our world itself, he writes, is in the dilemma of the lifeboat: it can only hold a certain number of people before it sinks--not everyone can be saved. The old idea of progress and limitless growth misses the point that the earth (and each part of it) has a limited carrying capacity; sentimentality should not cloud our ability to take necessary steps to limit population. But Hardin refutes the notion that goodwill and voluntary restraints will be enough. Instead, nations where population is growing must suffer the consequences alone. Too often, he writes, we operate on the faulty principle of shared costs matched with private profits. In Hardin's famous essay, \"The Tragedy of the Commons,\" he showed how a village common pasture suffers from overgrazing because each villager puts as many cattle on it as possible--since the costs of grazing are shared by everyone, but the profits go to the individual. The metaphor applies to global ecology, he argues, making a powerful case for closed borders and an end to immigration from poor nations to rich ones. \"The production of human beings is the result of very localized human actions; corrective action must be local....Globalizing the 'population problem' would only ensure that it would never be solved.\" Hardin does not shrink from the startling implications of his argument, as he criticizes the shipment of food to overpopulated regions and asserts that coercion in population control is inevitable. But he also proposes a free flow of information across boundaries, to allow each state to help itself. \"The time-honored practice of pollute and move on is no longer acceptable,\" Hardin tells us. We now fill the globe, and we have no where else to go. In this powerful book, one of our leading ecological philosophers points out the hard choices we must make--and the solutions we have been afraid to consider.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0198024037"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780198024033"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":true},"pageCount":352,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Philosophy"],"averageRating":4.5,"ratingsCount":12,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"1.1.4.0.preview.3","imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.dk/books/content?id=oA9-TUK3TrkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.dk/books/content?id=oA9-TUK3TrkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.dk/books?id=oA9-TUK3TrkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn:0198024037&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.dk/books?id=oA9-TUK3TrkC&dq=isbn:0198024037&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"http://books.google.dk/books/about/Living_within_Limits.html?hl=&id=oA9-TUK3TrkC"},"saleInfo":{"country":"DK","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":48.43,"currencyCode":"DKK"},"retailPrice":{"amount":36.32,"currencyCode":"DKK"},"buyLink":"http://books.google.dk/books?id=oA9-TUK3TrkC&dq=isbn:0198024037&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":48430000,"currencyCode":"DKK"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":36320000,"currencyCode":"DKK"}}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"DK","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.dk/books/download/Living_within_Limits-sample-epub.acsm?id=oA9-TUK3TrkC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.dk/books/download/Living_within_Limits-sample-pdf.acsm?id=oA9-TUK3TrkC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"webReaderLink":"http://books.google.dk/books/reader?id=oA9-TUK3TrkC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"We now fill the globe, and we have no where else to go.

Concepts such as Simplify, Focus the eye, Exploit the diagonal, Reverse expectations, and Say two things at once are illustrated with a diverse range of posters, from avant-garde classics and rarely seen international works to contemporary pieces by todays leading graphic designers.

The unique insight of this longtime best seller is that the major issues of software development are human, not technical. They’re not easy issues; but solve them, and you’ll maximize your chances of success. “Peopleware has long been one of my two favorite books on software engineering. Its underlying strength is its base of immense real experience, much of it quantified. Many, many varied projects have been reflected on and distilled; but what we are given is not just lifeless distillate, but vivid examples from which we share the authors’ inductions. Their premise is right: most software project problems are sociological, not technological. The insights on team jelling and work environment have changed my thinking and teaching. The third edition adds strength to strength.” — Frederick P. Brooks, Jr., Kenan Professor of Computer Science, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Author of The Mythical Man-Month and The Design of Design “Peopleware is the one book that everyone who runs a software team needs to read and reread once a year. In the quarter century since the first edition appeared, it has become more important, not less, to think about the social and human issues in software develop¿ment. This is the only way we’re going to make more humane, productive workplaces. Buy it, read it, and keep a stock on hand in the office supply closet.” —Joel Spolsky, Co-founder, Stack Overflow “When a book about a field as volatile as software design and use extends to a third edition, you can be sure that the authors write of deep principle, of the fundamental causes for what we readers experience, and not of the surface that everyone recognizes. And to bring people, actual human beings, into the mix! How excellent. How rare. The authors have made this third edition, with its additions, entirely terrific.” —Lee Devin and Rob Austin, Co-authors of The Soul of Design and Artful Making For this third edition, the authors have added six new chapters and updated the text throughout, bringing it in line with today’s development environments and challenges. For example, the book now discusses pathologies of leadership that hadn’t previously been judged to be pathological; an evolving culture of meetings; hybrid teams made up of people from seemingly incompatible generations; and a growing awareness that some of our most common tools are more like anchors than propellers. Anyone who needs to manage a software project or software organization will find invaluable advice throughout the book.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780133440737"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0133440737"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":true},"pageCount":272,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Computers"],"averageRating":4,"ratingsCount":178,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"4.221.202.0.preview.3","imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.dk/books/content?id=TVQUAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.dk/books/content?id=TVQUAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.dk/books?id=TVQUAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn:0133440737&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.dk/books?id=TVQUAAAAQBAJ&dq=isbn:0133440737&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"http://books.google.dk/books/about/Peopleware.html?hl=&id=TVQUAAAAQBAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"DK","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":242.43,"currencyCode":"DKK"},"retailPrice":{"amount":169.7,"currencyCode":"DKK"},"buyLink":"http://books.google.dk/books?id=TVQUAAAAQBAJ&dq=isbn:0133440737&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":242430000,"currencyCode":"DKK"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":169700000,"currencyCode":"DKK"}}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"DK","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY","epub":{"isAvailable":false},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://books.google.dk/books/reader?id=TVQUAAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"This is the only way we’re going to make more humane, productive workplaces."}}]},"bought":"2016-05-23"},{"number":"38","started":"2016-05-22","finished":null,"rating":null,"notes":"","details":{"kind":"books#volumes","totalItems":1,"items":[{"kind":"books#volume","id":"VP9TWZtVvq8C","etag":"m07GTkA1xkY","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/VP9TWZtVvq8C","volumeInfo":{"title":"Complexity","subtitle":"The Emerging Science at the Edge of Order and Chaos","authors":["Mitchell M.

Are the ancient questions still relevant in the age of cosmology and neuroscience, not to mention crowd-sourcing and cable news? The acclaimed philosopher and novelist Rebecca Newberger Goldstein provides a dazzlingly original plunge into the drama of philosophy, revealing its hidden role in today’s debates on religion, morality, politics, and science. At the origin of Western philosophy stands Plato, who got about as much wrong as one would expect from a thinker who lived 2,400 years ago. But Plato’s role in shaping philosophy was pivotal. On her way to considering the place of philosophy in our ongoing intellectual life, Goldstein tells a new story of its origin, re-envisioning the extraordinary culture that produced the man who produced philosophy. But it is primarily the fate of philosophy that concerns her. Is the discipline no more than a way of biding our time until the scientists arrive on the scene? Have they already arrived? Does philosophy itself ever make progress? And if it does, why is so ancient a figure as Plato of any continuing relevance? Plato at the Googleplex is Goldstein’s startling investigation of these conundra. She interweaves her narrative with Plato’s own choice for bringing ideas to life—the dialogue. Imagine that Plato came to life in the twenty-first century and embarked on a multicity speaking tour. How would he handle the host of a cable news program who denies there can be morality without religion? How would he mediate a debate between a Freudian psychoanalyst and a tiger mom on how to raise the perfect child? How would he answer a neuroscientist who, about to scan Plato’s brain, argues that science has definitively answered the questions of free will and moral agency? What would Plato make of Google, and of the idea that knowledge can be crowd-sourced rather than reasoned out by experts? With a philosopher’s depth and a novelist’s imagination and wit, Goldstein probes the deepest issues confronting us by allowing us to eavesdrop on Plato as he takes on the modern world.

Stoicism, as expressed in the Letters, helped ease pagan Rome's transition to Christianity, for it upholds upright ethical ideals and extols virtuous living, as well as expressing disgust for the harsh treatment of slaves and the inhumane slaughters witnessed in the Roman arenas. Seneca's major contribution to a seemingly unsympathetic creed was to transform it into a powerfully moving and inspiring declaration of the dignity of the individual mind.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780141914527"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0141914521"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":false},"pageCount":256,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Philosophy"],"averageRating":5,"ratingsCount":1,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"4.14.9.0.preview.2","imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.dk/books/content?id=hWlZTVgLmAkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.dk/books/content?id=hWlZTVgLmAkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.dk/books?id=hWlZTVgLmAkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn:0141914521&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.dk/books?id=hWlZTVgLmAkC&dq=isbn:0141914521&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"http://books.google.dk/books/about/Letters_from_a_Stoic.html?hl=&id=hWlZTVgLmAkC"},"saleInfo":{"country":"DK","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":65,"currencyCode":"DKK"},"retailPrice":{"amount":65,"currencyCode":"DKK"},"buyLink":"http://books.google.dk/books?id=hWlZTVgLmAkC&dq=isbn:0141914521&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":65000000,"currencyCode":"DKK"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":65000000,"currencyCode":"DKK"}}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"DK","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.dk/books/download/Letters_from_a_Stoic-sample-epub.acsm?id=hWlZTVgLmAkC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://books.google.dk/books/reader?id=hWlZTVgLmAkC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"Seneca&#39;s major contribution to a seemingly unsympathetic creed was to transform it into a powerfully moving and inspiring declaration of the dignity of the individual mind."}}]}},{"number":"34","started":"2016-01-14","finished":"2016-01-28","rating":2,"notes":"Too heavy and low level for me right now.
